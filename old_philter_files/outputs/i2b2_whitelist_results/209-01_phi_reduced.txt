 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** Health Center **PHI** **PHI** St Clifton Forge , WI **PHI** RE : **PHI** , **PHI** SFC #: **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** : I had the pleasure of seeing your patient , **PHI** **PHI** , in follow up today . He is a **PHI** , right-handed man who was admitted to the **PHI** Family Care on December **PHI** , **PHI** with left arm weakness , ataxia and dysarthria . The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke . An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata . The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission , despite being heparinized . The following day , he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side . Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally . There was no critical carotid stenosis . He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction , dilated left atrium , very mild inferior hypokinesis , and no patent foramen ovale . He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias . His cholesterol level was **PHI** with an HDL of **PHI** . It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery , involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries . He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis . He had been on aspirin prior , Plavix was added to his regimen . Since his discharge from the hospital , he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months . He has had no further episodes of weakness , numbness , tingling , ataxia , dysarthria , or dysphagia . He has no symptoms of aphasia . He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event , which he feels has improved . I would agree with him . He also has **PHI** some strength in the left leg , and is currently working on using a walker with assistance . Unfortunately , he has not **PHI** any use of the left arm . He has not had any problems with spasms . His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus . He had an inferior myocardial infarction in **PHI** . He had a quadruple bypass in **PHI** . His last stress test in **PHI** showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct . He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis . He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes . He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy . His medications currently include clonidine **PHI** mg. p.o . b.i.d., Plavix **PHI** mg. p.o . q.d., aspirin **PHI** mg. p.o . q.d., Neurontin **PHI** mg. p.o . q.h.s., Gemfibrozil **PHI** mg. p.o . b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix . He had been on Captopril earlier , but he has since been taken off that medicine . He was managed with insulin during his prior admission . I assume he is still on this medicine , although he did not specifically state so . He has an allergy to sulfa drugs . The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab **PHI** . The patient quit smoking **PHI** years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions . There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers , but no family history of stroke . On examination , he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress . His blood pressure was **PHI** . His language was intact . His speech was somewhat dysarthric , although this was improved from his admission . He was alert and oriented . His conversation was appropriate . The visual **PHI** were full . The pupils were equal and reactive at **PHI** mm . Facial sensation was normal . There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop . The tongue and palate were midline . The patient had **PHI** flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm . There was atrophy of the left biceps . There was full range of motion of the joints . The patient had **PHI** left iliopsoas , **PHI** hip extensors , **PHI** left quadriceps , **PHI** left ankle **PHI** , and **PHI** ankle plantar flexors . The tone in the lower extremities was not increased . His right side was **PHI** . He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe . His right toe was downgoing . Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick . I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy . Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes . He was in a wheelchair , and his gait was not assessed . Mr. **PHI** 's recovery is progressing . He has **PHI** some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker . I **PHI** that this will be the case . Unfortunately , his left arm has **PHI** flaccid and he has no movement . I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness . His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries . I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled , as has been done , and to continue an **PHI** agent . I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while . The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol . I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way . However , since he has been on this medicine so **PHI** , it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well . He should continue on an aspirin a day . He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost . I recommended to him that , in the experience of the Stroke Service at **PHI** Family Care , patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type . We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this . This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal . After six months , if he has had no further clinical events , it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin . I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months . I will arrange for carotid **PHI** and anterior transcranial **PHI** to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year 's time . The patient was seen and examined by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** of the **PHI** Family Care Stroke Service , who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination . Sincerely , **PHI** **PHI** , M. D. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**
