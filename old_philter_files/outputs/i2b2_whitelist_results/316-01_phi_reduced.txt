 Record date : **PHI** January **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Evergreen Court Hospital **PHI** Factory Street **PHI** , MN **PHI** RE : **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . MR # **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** : Thank you for kindly referring your patient , **PHI** **PHI** , to the Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension . Although I 'm sure you are familiar with his history , I will review it now for our records . Dr. **PHI** is a **PHI** retired Electrician at **PHI** Fargo who by his report has **PHI** excellent health until the past year . He denies any prior history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , chest pains , significant childhood illnesses or malignancy . He describes his usual baseline health as excellent . He is a religious walker , walking multiple times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast . Dr. **PHI** states that in approximately **PHI** or **PHI** the past year he was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia . This was treated with Metformin . Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added apparently for hypertension ( although the patient does not believe he has been diagnosed with hypertension ). He subsequently developed diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was subsequently reduced in dose . In **PHI** of the past year the patient was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his Hydrochlorothiazide . At that time he also was found to have lower extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the Hydrochlorothiazide . The patient states in September of **PHI** he **PHI** to trinidad and tobago . While in trinidad and tobago he had a marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he found it difficult to ambulate . He denied any difficulty with chest pains or shortness of breath . He had no hemoptysis and no focal unilateral leg swelling despite the **PHI** period of immobility during the trip . He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema significantly . However , he subsequently developed diarrhea to this medication and it was stopped . Subsequently his lower extremity has once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn . At the present time Dr. **PHI** states that he has no overt shortness of breath . He still able to sing vigorously and to play **PHI** without any Page **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . RE : **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . January **PHI** , **PHI** limitation . He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling in his lower extremities . He has no chest pain , has no cough , no sputum production , no hemoptysis . He has no fevers or chills . He believes his weight is increased by **PHI** pounds in the past several months . He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation . He denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note that he 's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is often **PHI** in the reclining chair which is new for him . He denies any history of snoring . He has noted no new joint complaints although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm . This has been present for approximately two or three months . Other than that he believes his bowel and bladder function is normal . Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable . His past medical history is significant for : **PHI** . Type II diabetes as above . **PHI** . An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his chart . **PHI** . Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide . **PHI** . Past history of right bundle branch block . He has no history of rheumatic fever . Current medications include Atenolol 25mg daily , folic acid , Glucophage 850mg bid , Lasix 120mg daily , Lisinopril 15mg daily , compression stockings , Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently . Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to Hydrochlorothiazide . Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus . Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an immigrant from trinidad and tobago . He has been living in **PHI** since the early **PHI** 's . He is a Electrician at **PHI** Fargo . He has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his bachelor 's degree but none since then . He is a non tobacco user . He uses alcohol minimally . He 's never had any blood transfusions . He lives with his wife . They have no pets . He does not enjoy any unusual hobbies not noted above . He has been exposed to tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD . On physical examination today Dr. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** pounds . Blood pressure is **PHI** . Pulse **PHI** and regular . Respiratory rate is **PHI** . Temperature is **PHI** . Resting oxygen saturation is **PHI** % with ambulation in the hallway . This fell to a minimum of **PHI** % with an increase in his heart rate to **PHI** . HEENT exam is significant for a clear oropharynx . Sclera are white . Conjunctiva are minimally pale . Page **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . RE : **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . January **PHI** , **PHI** The thyroid gland is normal . Jugular venous distention to approximately **PHI** cm . was noted . Neck was supple . Examination of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness at both bases . There was no egophony and no wheezes . Otherwise the lungs were clear . Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , an intermittent S4 was appreciated . No RV heave or lift was appreciated . No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated . The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced . No appreciable murmurs were detected . The point of maximum impulse was in the anterior axillary line . Examination of the abdomen revealed a nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge , three **PHI** below the right costal margin . This was nontender and smooth . Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well . Normal bowel sounds were present . Examination of the extremities reveal three plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower extremities , one plus edema was also present in both upper extremities . No clubbing was noted . There were no skin changes consistent with collagen vascular disease . Multiple follicular lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as well as on the left arm . Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal . Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a white count of **PHI** , hematocrit of **PHI** , platelet count of **PHI** . Differential was not remarkable . LVH is elevated at **PHI** , AST is most recently **PHI** . A urinalysis on **PHI** was negative for protein . No **PHI** cast was made . A CEA was notable for a level of **PHI** on **PHI** . An echocardiogram obtained on **PHI** demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved LV function . The right ventricle was mildly dilated and hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function . There was trace MR with moderate TR . A peak systolic artery pressure of **PHI** plus right atrial pressure was noted . In summary Dr. **PHI** is a **PHI** gentleman with a clear cut pulmonary hypertension . The etiology of this is not clear at the moment . Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic disease , occult underlying pulmonary disease ( doubt ), obstructive sleep apnea , and collagen vascular disease . In addition some patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of exclusion . The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree with increasing his diuretic regimen . I 'm **PHI** on a course of evaluation to exclude the most likely causes . In specific he will be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic disease this afternoon . This has already been arranged by Dr. **PHI** . In addition I 'm sending serology including an ANA , an **PHI** stranded DNA and an anti **PHI** . I 've also asked Dr. **PHI** Page **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . RE : **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . January **PHI** , **PHI** to undergo **PHI** to exclude obstructive sleep apnea . He will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an arterial blood gas drawn . If this evaluation should be unrevealing , he may require more invasive diagnostics . I 've already **PHI** formally with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , the physician with most experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. **PHI** if our workup is nondiagnostic . Dr. **PHI** , thank you again for referring Dr. **PHI** for evaluation . I 'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four **PHI** after his diagnostic tests have been performed . Please do not hesitate to call me with any further questions or concerns . Sincerely , **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . /ray DD : **PHI** DT : **PHI** DV : **PHI**
