 Record date : **PHI** Graydon **PHI** Jean , MD Nevada Hospital Internal Medicine **PHI** Dan **PHI** **PHI** City , NH **PHI** Dear **PHI** : I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. **PHI** **PHI** in clinic today . As you know , he is a **PHI** gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at **PHI** in **PHI** with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction . I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery . I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings . The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to **PHI** . At that time in **PHI** he had several days of very **PHI** chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged . He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in **PHI** . He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions **PHI** and **PHI** %), first OM ( **PHI** %) and his right ( dominant vessel with an **PHI** % proximal and then **PHI** % distal ). An LV gram showed an EF of **PHI** % with just mild mitral regurgitation . An echo performed here at the **PHI** was consistent . Since he has returned to America several **PHI** ago , he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort , which occurred when he was getting **PHI** to come to the clinic . Since then , he has had no further episodes . ROS : Denies PND , orthopnea , symptoms of TIA , stroke , lightheaded , or syncope . He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion . PMH : Diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , stroke ( numbness in his right hand and leg , but that had predominantly resolved ). Meds : aspirin **PHI** mg a day , clopidogrel **PHI** mg a day , bisoprolol **PHI** mg once a day , ranitidine **PHI** mg a day , atorvastatin **PHI** mg a day , metformin **PHI** mg b.i.d., and Imdur **PHI** mg in the morning and **PHI** in the evening . This is an **PHI** formulation . SHx : He does not drink , nor smoke . FHx : Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at **PHI** . Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate . On exam , he looks well . His heart rate is in the **PHI** . His blood pressure was **PHI** . His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no **PHI** . His jugular venous pressures were not elevated . His chest was clear to auscultation . His cardiac exam revealed a **PHI** holosystolic murmur at the apex . His abdomen was soft . Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses . Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit . In summary , Mr. **PHI** is a very nice Spanish speaking **PHI** gentleman with diabetes and a significant **PHI** disease . He is likely **PHI** **PHI** for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time **PHI** why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory . I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to **PHI** . With warm regards , Sincerely yours ,
