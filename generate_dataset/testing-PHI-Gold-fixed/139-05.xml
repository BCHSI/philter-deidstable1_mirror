MSH Adult Medicine Office Visit                              PCP Dr Whitehead



73 yr old woman with HTN, SP CABG, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K.

She was hospitalized in 7/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.  At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx.  Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early August her K+ rose a bit.  The VNA has been seeing her at home.  According to the patient her BP has been "normal".

She and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA.  They are seeing me because there  were no appts available for her with her PCP.  

She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath.  Appetite is good.

She has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K+ content of many foods.

She has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2095 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years.

REPORT

     EXAMINATION: MRA RENAL ARTERIES

     PROCEDURE: MRA of the aorta and renal arteries was obtained according

     to standard department protocol.  3D images were obtained and

     interpreted.

     FINDINGS: The celiac, SMA and IMA are patent.  There are bilateral

     single renal arteries.  There is a moderate length moderate stenosis

     of the right renal artery, and the left renal artery is widely patent.

     The solid abdominal viscera, as visualized, are unremarkable.  There

     is a prominent left gonadal vein.

IMPRESSION

      MODERATE STENOSIS OF THE RIGHT RENAL ARTERY

     

Type: Ultr., Kidney Date/Time: 07/23/2097 12:41 PM HISTORY: SOB AND DIZZINESS ASSESS HYDRONEPHROSIS REPORT History: Question hydronephrosis. Images from an ultrasound study of the kidneys and the bladder were acquired. There are no prior studies for comparison. Both kidneys are normal in size and lie. The right kidney measures 9.8 and the left kidney measures 9.7 cm in sagittal dimension. No hydronephrosis or dominant solid masses are seen. Notice made of a right extrarenal pelvis. The bladder is moderately distended without intraluminal lesions. 

IMPRESSION No hydronephrosis.

According to discharge summary of hospitalization in 7/97, urine was negative for eosinophils.



A:  73 yr old with HTN has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking ACEi concomitantly with NSAID.  The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7/2097 and again in early August is unclear.

She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms. 

I don't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi.  



P:  Her daughter had many questions about what this type of "blockage" means and about prognosis.  

I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion, renal function, and to advise her about the role/impact of ACEi for BP and her heart (her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn't take the ACEi).  

I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID. 

I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction.

Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K+ foods.

Check lytes, renal function, Phos, Ca and Alb today.

Will discuss Nephrology consultation with Dr Whitehead.



She has an appt with Dr Whitehead on 8/27.



Length of visit was 45 minutes.
