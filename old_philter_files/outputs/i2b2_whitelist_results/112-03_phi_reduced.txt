 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** , CLARENCE **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Y. **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** Internal Medicine **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Road **PHI** , OH **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** : I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. **PHI** in followup in Cardiology today . As you know , he is a **PHI** gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on **PHI** for his presyncope and **PHI** on Holter monitoring . His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and asthma . Prior to his pacemaker placement , an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain . He was able to exercise for **PHI** minutes and **PHI** seconds . The test was terminated for **PHI** substernal chest pain , but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted . We **PHI** to pacemaker implant and Mr. **PHI** has done well since that time . He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved . However , he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort . He tells me that he underwent testing at **PHI** Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality , though the report of this test is not available to me today for review . Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE **PHI** pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction . The estimated longevity on the battery life is **PHI** months . The atrial impedance is **PHI** **PHI** and the ventricular impedance is **PHI** **PHI** . The **PHI** in the atrium is **PHI** mV and the **PHI** in the ventricle is **PHI** mV . The threshold in the atrium is stable at **PHI** V at **PHI** msec , and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at **PHI** V at **PHI** msec . In summary , the pacemaker appears to be working quite well . However , Mr. **PHI** **PHI** in a **PHI** sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation . I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia . In addition , I have performed a **PHI** ECG , which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia . Today in the office , his sinus rate is **PHI** beats per minute with stable blood pressure . Mr. **PHI** and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable . I have discussed this case with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. **PHI** in the near future , since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the **PHI** . I plan to see Mr. **PHI** in followup in three months ' time for his pacemaker . If any issues arise in the interim , please do not hesitate to contact me . Sincerely , **PHI** Una **PHI** , MD eScription **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** DD : **PHI** DT : **PHI** DV : **PHI**
