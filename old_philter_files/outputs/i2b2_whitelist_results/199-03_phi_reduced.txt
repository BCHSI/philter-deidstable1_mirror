 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** Resident 's history , physical examination , and evaluation reviewed by me and I concur . In addition , I personally **PHI** and examined this patient . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This is a **PHI** male with history of elevated cholesterol who presents for evaluation of intermittent neck pain and arm discomfort over the course of the last several **PHI** and now with substernal chest pain radiating to the neck since **PHI** hours prior to admission . The patient does not have any documented history of CAD . He has noted over the last several **PHI** episodes of exertional right-sided neck aching and arm discomfort with arm numbness , which seems to occur with exertion and resolve with rest . He has no noted over the last week , but on exertion , he has had episodes of bilateral neck aching discomfort with radiating achy into both of the arms . His symptoms generally resolve with rest . Today , approximately **PHI** hours prior to presentation , he was driving when he had the onset of bilateral neck and arm aching pain with substernal chest discomfort , shortness of breath , a sensation of palpitations and mild sweatiness . He had no nausea and no vomiting . His symptoms **PHI** over the course of last several hours , and he presented to the Emergency Department for evaluation . He denies any prior history of chest pain in the past . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Positive only for elevated cholesterol and questionable history of PE in the past . He did smoke in the past and drinks occasionally . He lives with his significant other . FAMILY HISTORY : Reviewed and is positive for early CAD in his father . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS : Other systems are reviewed and otherwise negative except per the HPI . MEDICATIONS : Only Lipitor . ALLERGIES : No medical allergies . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Temperature is **PHI** , pulse **PHI** , respirations **PHI** , blood pressure **PHI** , and the O2 saturation is **PHI** %. The patient is awake , alert , middle age male who appears mildly uncomfortable but in no respiratory distress , reclining on the stretcher . Head examination is normocephalic , atraumatic . His pupils are equal and reactive to light . His sclerae are anicteric . His conjunctivae are pink and moist . He has moist mucous membranes with no erythema . His neck is supple and nontender . The trachea is midline . There is no adenopathy . There is no JVD . He has full range of motion . There is no subcutaneous emphysema . His lungs reveal mild tachypnea . There is no chest wall tenderness . There is no accessory muscle use . He has bibasilar crackles in both lower lung **PHI** . There is no wheezing and equal breath sounds . His cardiac examination is tachycardic and regular at about **PHI** with a **PHI** systolic murmur heard prominently at the apex as well as at the right second intercostal space . There is no rub . His pulses are normal . His abdomen is minimally obese but **PHI** , soft , nontender , no guarding , no peritoneal signs . There is no organomegaly and no pulsatile masses . His skin is intact , warm , somewhat moist but not diaphoretic . There are no rashes . Extremities reveal no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema . Calves are soft and nontender with no palpable cords , full range of motion with normal strength and tone . He is oriented x3 . Cranial nerves are intact . There is no motor or sensory deficit . EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE : The patient had IV access initiated . He was placed on a cardiac monitor . EKG was performed . He received **PHI** time sublingual nitroglycerin with a drop in his blood pressure to systolic in the high **PHI** . A second IV was placed . Right-sided EKG leads were performed , and the patient received IV fluid bolus . He had already received aspirin . His white blood cell count is **PHI** , hematocrit **PHI** , and platelets **PHI** . His electrolytes are within normal limits . His BUN is **PHI** , creatinine **PHI** , and glucose **PHI** . His CK was **PHI** . His troponin was less than assay . His initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm in the **PHI** with a normal axis , normal intervals . His pseudonormalization noted only in lead III . He has approximately **PHI** mm ST depression with normal ST segments in the anteroseptal leads with somewhat hyperacute appearing T waves . Right-sided leads show some mild , less than 1-mm , ST upward sloping in V2 through V5 . He had a chest x-ray performed that showed a normal mediastinum and some mild fluffy alveolar infiltrates in the bases but no obvious consolidation and no significant cephalization . He had blood pressures checked in both arms once his blood pressure improved after an IV fluid bolus and was noted to have a persistent **PHI** point difference in systolic blood pressures of **PHI** on the right and **PHI** on the left . When the patient was **PHI** about this , he states that he has had that noted in his doctor 's office in the past . He underwent CT scanning of the chest , which ruled out aortic dissection after discussion with the attending radiologist . As his blood pressure stabilized , he received IV Lopressor and became pain free . He did not require any further nitroglycerin . Repeat EKG was performed showing resolution of the **PHI** mm ST depression in the anterior leads . Given the patient 's cardiac risk factor and his history , which is fairly worrisome for Not reviewed by Attending Physician with a diagnosis of chest pain , rule out **PHI** angina . He does remain pain free now and has maintained a stable blood pressure after IV fluid bolus . See the note for full details . Critical care time was **PHI** minutes . **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** M.D .
