 Record date **PHI** EDVISIT^ **PHI**^ **PHI**^ **PHI**^ **PHI** CHIEF COMPLAINT Fever. I saw this patient with Dr. **PHI**. Please see his note for further details. I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 56 year old gentleman with end stage MS at nursing home. He has indwelling Foley catheter. He was transported from nursing home to ED as he has had a fever today to approximately 100.5. Per EMS, they were told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased POs today. He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat. He then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more awake and alert. He is telling the paramedics that he is at his baseline. He denies to me any headaches, neck pain. No chest pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers or chills. He reports that he is able to discern when he has abdominal pain. He has intact sensation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY As per HPI. In addition, CAD, diabetes, hypertension, CHF. Please see resident note for list of medication and allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY He does not smoke. He does not drink. He is at a nursing home. He is married. FAMILY HISTORY Noncontributory. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS As per resident note and my HPI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no distress. Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure 102 66, O2 saturation 99% on room air. HEENT exam Normocephalic and atraumatic. Neck Supple. He has coarse upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly. Heart is regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is slightly distended. He is nontender. He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing, no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower extremities. He is alert and does say yes or no to questions. The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his urinary tract infection. His urine and his catheter was cloudy. Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the lab, the patient had his catheter changed. He then began to no longer drain urine. Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on using ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder. Attempts were made to change the catheter, but they were unsuccessful. There was pus found at the meatus. At this point, the patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology evaluation. He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI and or abscess. LABORATORY DATA Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136. LFTs within normal limits. Normal lipase. White count of 5.7, hematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000. Coags within normal limits. UA again is pending at this time. He will be admitted to the hospital. I attempted to reach the patient's primary care physician, Dr. **PHI** to contact from the WBM office, however, my calls went unanswered. At this point, I am signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and urology evaluation. DIAGNOSIS Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end stage MS. CONDITION Stable. DISPOSITION Will be admitted. **PHI** MD D **PHI** T **PHI** Dictated By **PHI** eScription document **PHI** BFFocus ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
