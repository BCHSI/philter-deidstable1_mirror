Briefly, 68 yr old male w a h/o HTN, HL, DMII, peripheral neuropathy, schizoaffective disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder s/p SVT ablation on 4/10 who post-operatively has been confused with gait disturbance. Neurology was consulted for an evaluation of gait disturbance and encephalopathy. On exam patient is normotensive and afebrile with cognition remarkable for inattention, disorientation, perseveration and preservation of speech and visual spatial processing.

-Check B12, folate, RPR, TSH

-please start multivitamin and thiamine 100mg daily
-please check carbamazepine and valproic acid levels; please verify carbamazepine dosing as prior records suggest 400mg QD and patient is on BID dosing

-serum and urine toxicology screen

-obtain collateral history regarding possible alcohol abuse and monitor for alcohol withdrawal

-would hold amitriptyline given anticholinergic properties

-if above workup negative and unrevealing would consider NCHCT but defer imaging at this time
