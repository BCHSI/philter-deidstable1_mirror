Internal Medicine - MSIII Admission Note



Pt: Crawford, Patrick (Mary 3562Z)

MR#: 	902-15-55

Date of Admission: 10/10/92

Attending: 	Yancey, Ursula

PCP: Estep, Willa

Code status: Full





CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis



HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.  He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.  He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.  He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.  He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.  He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.  When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.



One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.  Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.  As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.  According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.  He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.  He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.  Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.  At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.



In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.  He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.  He has had no other symptoms.  Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.  He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.  Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.

_____________________________________________________________________________________



Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.  Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.  No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.  No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.  Stable Hct.  Likely etiologies include:



1.	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.  EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.  Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.  Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.



2.	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.  Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.



3.	Prazosin-induced hypotension.  In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.



4.	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.





Plan:



Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers

		- Telemetry

		- 24 hr Holter monitor

		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler

		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m.

		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr

		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient

		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd



DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m.

		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet



OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN



Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol



Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc.
