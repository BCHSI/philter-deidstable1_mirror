 Record date : **PHI** CARDIOLOGY **PHI** MEDICAL CLINIC **PHI** N **PHI** M.D . **PHI** Medical Clinic **PHI** Harbor Avenue , **PHI** Pullman , MN **PHI** Dear **PHI** : Thank you very much for referring Mr. **PHI** for evaluation of coronary disease , mitral insufficiency , atrial fibrillation , and congestive heart failure . As you know , he is a **PHI** gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on **PHI** and had **PHI** CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery . Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a **PHI** procedure . The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting . After the coronary artery bypass grafting , he had done well but now is **PHI** that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has **PHI** . It has been progressive over the last several months . He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux . He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that . He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring . Past medical history : Notable for **PHI** diabetes . Hypertension . Hypercholesterolemia . Hyperhomocysteinemia . Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . Benign prostatic hypertrophy . Gout . Renal insufficiency . Mild thrombocytopenia . Current Medications : atenolol **PHI** mg BID Coumadin ; Dir : as directed Ecotrin **PHI** mg qd Lipitor **PHI** mg qd Lasix **PHI** mg qd folate **PHI** mg qd allopurinol **PHI** mg qd Ativan Proscar free text medications ; Dir : Insulin Protonix Allergies : No known drug allergy or IV contrast dye . Family history : Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of **PHI** and another brother with congestive heart failure . There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family . Social history : The patient has a **PHI** history of smoking , quit in **PHI** . He does not drink alcohol . He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping . Review of systems : Negative for fevers , chills , weight loss or gain . He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss . He denies hematochezia . He has not had difficulty swallowing , change in bowel habits , constipation , diarrhea , or hematemesis . He denies chest pain , PND , orthopnea , or pedal edema . He denies dysuria or hematuria . He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions . Physical examination : -Pulse : **PHI** and regular -BP : **PHI** in the right and left arm in seated position -resp . rate : **PHI** and unlabored -Heent : No xanthelasma , scleral icterus , proptosis , or lid lag . Mucous membranes are moist . Trachea is midline -Neck : Thyroid is not palpable . Carotids are 2+ without **PHI** . Have a normal upstroke . JVP is less than **PHI** cm of water -Chest : Clear without rales , rhonchi , or wheezes . He does have low dullness in both bases -Cardiac : Remarkable for **PHI** midline incision of the sternum . He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade **PHI** holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade **PHI** high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur -Abdomen : Normal bowel sounds . No organomegaly . No pulsatile masses -Extremities : Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric . He has no pedal edema . He has no clubbing or cyanosis Procedures : Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on . His heart rate from **PHI** to **PHI** which was only **PHI** % of the maximal predicted heart rate . Peak blood pressure was **PHI** . He had no chest pain . Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with **PHI** ischemia in that distribution . The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand . EKG : today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about **PHI** , leftward axis , and IVCD with nonspecific **PHI** wave abnormalities . Selected recent labs : Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of **PHI** , BUN of **PHI** , hematocrit of **PHI** , white count of **PHI** , and platelet count of **PHI** all done on **PHI** and **PHI** . Assessment and plan : In summary , this is a **PHI** gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting , closure of PFO , and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July **PHI** . His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again . There are a number of factors involved here . He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled . I doubt that , that is playing a role in his shortness of breath . He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura . He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO . He has **PHI** diabetes and hypertension . He also has low platelets . The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia . It may be that there are other issues contributing to this , the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation . He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation , but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time . Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile . He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well . My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this . He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done . I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease , but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization . I would like to get the echocardiogram , bring him in for cardiac catheterization , and see if there are **PHI** either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia . Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth **PHI** or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization . Because of renal insufficiency , cardiac catheterization is a **PHI** bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address .
