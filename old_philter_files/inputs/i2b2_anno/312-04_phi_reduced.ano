The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions. The patient first noticed a problem on **PHI**, and by the **PHI** he said that "the access had collapsed." On **PHI**, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis. At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy revision. Of note, patient was admitted in **PHI** after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur. Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin. ROS No fever chills, HA, SOB, CP, N V D (though states that stomach sometimes "sensitive").
