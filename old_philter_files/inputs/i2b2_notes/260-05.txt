CC/RFA:  Pt is a 61-year-old man w/ CAD, DM, HTN hypercholesterolemia and recurrent atrial flutter admitted for atrial flutter ablation. 

HPI:  Pt   s cardiac hx begins in 2069 when he presented with chest pain and palpitations while shoveling snow and was found to be in atrial flutter. Pt was subsequently cardioverted to NSR. Pt did well post cardioversion. He was suffered NSTEMI in 11/72 in the setting of bactermia and Streptococcal cellulitis. Coronary angiography showed diffuse non-critical disease; decision was made to manage CAD medically. Pt was found to be in atrial flutter on follow up visit with cardiology. He was referred to Dr. Uher in appx two weeks prior to admission, who recommended radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter. 

Pt underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter on 2/7/73. The procedure was was successful and the patient was transferred to the floor in normal sinus rhythm. He has no complaints and specifically reports no CP/SOB/palpitations.

PMH:
Coronary artery disease
Diabetes
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Atrial flutter.
Hx Bell   s palsy: residual left eye tearing thought to be due to aberrant reinnervation
Kidney stones
Glaucoma
Mild renal failure

Cardiac Hx/Risk Factors: 
Echocardiogram (11/72): EF 71%; left ventricular function normal with symmetric hypertrophy; minimal valvular disease

Stress Test (3/69): normal exercise capacity (METS achieved =  7.); ECG response to stress was  nondiagnostic for ischemia; myocardial perfusion scan show a small, mild posterobasal defect which improves at rest suggestive for a very limited area of mild ischemia

Cardiac Catheterization (11/72): Diffuse mild to moderate CAD: LMCA - 20% plaque; LAD - diffuse plaque; LCx - Diffuse plque in a small AV groove artery; RCA - patent proximally; calcified; Occluded right after take off of PDA, distal branches fill by collats from L
