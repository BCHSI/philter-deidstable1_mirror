History of Present Illness:  
Patient w/ severe COPD (PFT not available).  Reports coughing x 3wks, productive of light, white sputum.  Has had intermittent, fluctuating symptoms of cough/DOE since then.  10d prior, seen at VGH ED and was discharged w/ prednisone (7d course).  He reports that his symptoms never improved on prednisone.  At baseline, he is able to walk 40-50y flat ground and several flights of stairs; limited by dyspnea.  Now, has dyspnea at rest and cannot climb 1 flight of stairs.  Saw his PCPs NP on the day of admission and was referred to WMC.  Denies clear precipitant, denies sick contacts, h/o seasonal allergies. 

In the ED, VS: T 98.1 HR 100-114 BP95/55-172/79 RR24-36 O2sat 96%4L.  He was noted to be visibly dyspneic, wheezes on exam w/ an irregular heartbeat.  He was transferred to trauma for close observation of respiratory status, although he did not require PPV or ABG.  BNP 136, cardiac markers neg x 1.  WBC returned at 17.5.  AP CXR was indeterminate for clear PNA.  Patient was started on albuterol/atrovent nebs, solumedrol 125mg, ceftriaxone/azithromycin for possible PNA.  

Review of Systems:
Chest pressure sensation,    muscle tightness   , L sided, intermittent lasting only minutes, nonradiating, non-exertional, nonpleuritic, non-positional.

EKG tachycardia, at least two atrial foci. RBBB.
CXR L lower lung opacity. Poor film.

Impression/Plan: 
87yoM h/o COPD, vascular disease p/w SOB, cough.  Likely COPD flare.  High WBC may be steroids, but CXR too poor to rule out PNA.  Otherwise, no clear precipitant.  Failed steroids as outpatient (dosing unclear).  Given level of dyspnea, will treat w/ solumedrol for now, and transition to prednisone when improvement/trajectory is clear.  Patient may need a longer taper than over 10d.

SOB: COPD flare +/- PNA.
	-repeat CXR in AM.
-solumedrol 125mg q6 for now.  Transition to prednisone 1mg/kg when clinically stable.  Follow trend, decide on length of taper at later date.
-advair, spiriva.  Standing albuterol nebs q4 for now.  Space nebs when improvement demonstrated.
-keep O2 sats 88-92%
CHEST PRESSURE: follow for now.  Would deserve stress.  Unless  has more activity/symptoms while here, would defer to be done as outpatient.  Does have significant risk factors.
	-ROMI by markers.
	-telemetry.
	-ASA, ARB, statin.
	-start low dose beta-blocker to see if he tolerates.
HTN: likely exacerbated by steroids.  Will be moving target in setting of changing steroid dose.
	-c/w home ARB.
	-start lopressor 25 tid for now.
	-hydralazine 25mg q6h for immediate decrease in BP now.  Taper off when able.
DM2: no meds from home
	-RISS, FS qid.
	-check A1c.
FEN: no added salt, low cholesterol/fat, no conc sweets
PROPHY: fragmin, zantac.
CODE: full code (confirmed w/ patient)
DISPO: PT eval.
