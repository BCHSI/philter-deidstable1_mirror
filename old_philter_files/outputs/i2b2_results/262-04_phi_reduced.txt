BG thalamus hemorrhage with **PHI** extension , with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration Critical Care Min 35 min History Ms. **PHI** is a 75 year old **PHI** with DM , HTN and dementia , **PHI** at 11 00 a.m., then found by son at 1 45 pm to be less responsive with left sided weakness . BP was 200 96 when EMS arrived . Here her **PHI** was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50 60s . Her initial exam revealed somnolence , but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand , nodding head ; she had right gaze deviation , left hemianopsia , left facial palsy , left arm and leg plegia , right arm and leg paresis , and dysarthria . She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her **PHI** greater than 220 . CT revealed a right basal ganglia thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle , 7 mm mls to the left , contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality . She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a line placed for Bp monitoring and management . At baseline , Ms. **PHI** is wheelchair bound , according to her daughter , due to her neuropathy . She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide .

CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality . Assessment **PHI** is a 75 year old right handed woman with diabetes mellitus , HTN and dementia , and found with a 11 cc R. BG thalamic bleed with pan ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles , and mild midline shift . The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature ; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly . A mass lesion can not be excluded at this time however , and will need an MRI . Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC ( 8 ) and ICH ( 2 ) scores given her clinical status and medical comorbidities .
