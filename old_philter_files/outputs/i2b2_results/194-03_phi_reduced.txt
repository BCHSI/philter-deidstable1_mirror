Of note , he had one episode of diarrhea that morning . He denied any fevers or chills , or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode . When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor , he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated , and was told he was diaphoretic . He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber , and upchucked . After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded . Ems was called , and upon arrival at the ED , he had another episode of diarrhea . At no point did he have chest pain . He did not lose consciousness . This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092 . In general , he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis . However , he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain . The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc . He has not been experiencing any palpitations , or shortness of breath . He denies any headache , visual changes , dysuria , abdominal pain , sore throat . He has heard that there is a bug going around , but denies sick contacts . ED Course Upon presentation to ED , HR 50 , BP 141 62 , 18 , 99 % RA , afebrile .

Certainly in someone with known CAD , cardiogenic near syncope is most concerning , namely , MI , with atypical features . However , his EKG is unchanged , his troponins are negative , and he never had chest pain . Perhaps his light headedness is secondary to bradycardia , as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s . However , I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis , was dehydrated , and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion . It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen . There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story .
