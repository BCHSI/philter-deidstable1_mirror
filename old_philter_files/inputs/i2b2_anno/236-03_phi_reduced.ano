 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**, M.D. Internal Medicine Barton Memorial Hospital **PHI** **PHI**, TN **PHI** Re **PHI** MR# **PHI** Dear **PHI** Mrs. **PHI** returns for routine follow up. At the present time, she continues to complain of exertional angina, and states that she is willing to consider undergoing cardiac catheterization. As you know, I had suggested this to her last **PHI**. She continues now on a regimen of Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.d., Humalog 10 units sub.q. q.a.m., NPH 25 units sub.q. q.a.m., sliding scale CZI throughout the day, isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase, Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Celexa. Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 92 60, heart rate 75 and regular. Respirations 12 and unlabored. Weight 109 pounds. This is one pound above her weight of six months ago. The neck is supple. JVP is flat. Carotids with continuing right greater than left bruits. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam reveals a normal, physiologically split S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base. No significant diastolic murmur. The abdomen is benign. Extremities are without edema. The pulses are intact. Electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm at a rate of 75, PR interval .12, QRS .08, QT .34, axis 75 degrees. There are lateral ST and T wave changes compatible with strain or ischemia. Compared to her last electrocardiogram, there has been no significant change. Impression Ms. **PHI** is a 48 year old woman with a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, and significant **PHI** MR# **PHI** **PHI** 2 coronary artery disease. She is status post intramammary artery graft to her LAD, after developing restenosis at the site of a balloon LAD angioplasty. The results of the catheterization will determine subsequent therapeutic recommendations. She will have her insulin dose on the morning of her scheduled catheterization. Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care. Sincerely yours, **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
