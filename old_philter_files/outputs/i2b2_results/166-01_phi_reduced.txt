 Record date **PHI** PATIENT NAME **PHI** , **PHI** ; MRN **PHI** Dictated on **PHIDate** by **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE DATE OF CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS T2b , NX , M0 Gleason 4+3 = 7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate . HISTORY Mr. **PHI** is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . His PSA in 2093 was 3.8 , early this year 6.3 , and on repeat 7.1 . Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam . He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream , no dribbling , nor any frequency . He does still have his erections , though they are not as good as they used to be . The erections are still an important issue with him . Dr. **PHI** performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate . He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer . In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7 . Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern . Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40 % involvement or more . Mr. **PHI** has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1 . Diabetes . 2 . Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy . 3 . Tonsillectomy . 4 . Right inguinal hernia repair . 5 . Inflammatory bowel disease . CURRENT MEDICATIONS Glipizide , metformin , and Avandia . DRUG ALLERGIES None known . SOCIAL HISTORY His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s , but he did not die from his disease . SOCIAL HISTORY He works as a Web Developer in **PHI** . He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today . He has no children . He is a former smoker and occasional drinker . PHYSICAL EXAM No anemia , jaundice , cyanosis , or clubbing No gynecomastia Respiration comfortable No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs No skeletal deformity or tenderness Head , eyes , ears , and nose normal Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , nor any additional masses . No hernias . Normal penis , scrotum , and testes . Rectum no mural lesion . Stool guaiac negative Prostate is small . The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor . IMPRESSION AND PLAN Mr. **PHI** is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer . I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him , which is a shame , as that was his preference . Left untreated , I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years . His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment . On balance , my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy , perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively , if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does , for him to have high dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation . While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this . We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans . Obviously , should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table , if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long term androgen deprivation . Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . cc **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
