DATE OF VISIT : **PHI** REASON FOR VISIT : Reassessment of progress , s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma , **PHI** stage IIB , s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy ( **PHI** ) with pathologic tumor stage **PHI** ( **PHI** involved lymph nodes ). POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY : For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes , he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy . He was treated with a total dose of **PHI** Gy in **PHI** fractions to the tumor bed region using **PHI** , planned with 4D CT simulation . This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March **PHI** , **PHI** , and Apr **PHI** , **PHI** . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr. **PHI** **PHI** is a **PHI** **PHI** gentleman with a history of smoking , chronic GERD , HTN , CAD s/p PCI , partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x **PHI** .

On **PHI** EGD at **PHI** Hospital demonstrated a **PHI** distal esophageal mass **PHI** cm from the incisors , associated with Barrett &# **PHI** ; s esophagus , with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma . On **PHI** CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus . On **PHI** repeat CT of the chest showed an **PHI** mm LLL nodule and **PHI** pleural thickening . Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from **PHI** cm with **PHI** mm thickness , suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria , one suspicious mediastinal LN , and porta hepatis adenopathy . On **PHI** FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative . He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on **PHI** . Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring **PHI** cm , invading into muscularis propria ( pT2 ) and metastasis to **PHI** of **PHI** LN ( N1 ). INTERVAL **PHI** OF SYSTEMS : He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms . He has maintained steady energy and appetite . He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat . Otherwise , he has been doing well . He denies significant respiratory symptoms . No focal or generalized neurological symptoms . The remainder of review of systems was unremarkable .
