Southwest Colorado Medical Health Center **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** DOB **PHIDate** Thank you for referring Mr. **PHI** to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation . As you know him well , I will summarize his history briefly for our records . Mr. **PHI** is a 78 year old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories , a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35 40 %, and atrial fibrillation . In addition , he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia , and obstructive sleep apnea . In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed , he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA . He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea . On further questioning , he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway . He can walk no further than approximately 50 100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue . He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent . He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in **PHIDate** , but was unsuccessful . Prior to that , cardioversion in **PHI** resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved . He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left sided chest discomfort . Cardiac catheterization on **PHIDate** revealed a 30 % LAD in stent restenosis , 90 % septal lesion , and 65 % 70 % PDA lesion that was stented . A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35 40 %. Other than significant exertional shortness of breath , he feels relatively well . He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope . He denies any PND , orthopnea , or lower extremity swelling . He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations . His weight has been stable . On review of systems , he denies any fevers , chills , or night sweats . His weight has remained stable . He denies any new onset cough , wheezing , or hemoptysis . Past Medical History 1 . CAD status post LAD PCI stenting in 2155 . He developed in stent restenosis in **PHIDate** , during which time he received a second drug eluting stent to the LAD lesion . He developed recurrent chest discomfort in **PHIDate** , and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80 % mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30 % proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis . He underwent a drug eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion . A followup catheterization in **PHIDate** revealed a 30 % LAD stenosis , 90 % large septal branch lesion , and a 65 70 % proximal PDA stenosis . Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35 40 %. He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on **PHIDate** . An exercise **PHI** performed in **PHIDate** revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia . 2 . Hypertension . 3 . Dyslipidemia . 4 . Diabetes . 5 . Obstructive sleep apnea . 6 . COPD , prescribed home oxygen , though he is not taking this . 7 . Carotid disease , status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax . 8.? History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in **PHIDate** . 9 . Atrial fibrillation . 10 . Obesity . He has no known drug allergies . His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK , but this has been discontinued since **PHI** , metoprolol **PHI** mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Zocor 20 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , TriCor 145 mg daily , Lasix 20 mg daily , BLANK 5 mg nightly , aspirin 325 mg daily , Lantus insulin 62 units daily , Humalog insulin , and Protonix 40 mg daily . His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence . He was formally employed in buidling construction . He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection . He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol . His family history is negative for early onset CAD , sudden cardiac death , or cardiomyopathy . His father lived until the age of 88 . His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80 . He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles . Physical Examination His blood pressure is 115 60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute . In general , he is overweight elderly man in no distress . Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles . Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally . Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the **PHI** , but otherwise clear . There is no wheezing . Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2 . There is no audible murmur , rub or gallop . Abdomen is obese , soft , and nontender . Lower extremities are warm and well perfused . There is trace pitting edema at the ankles . Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on **PHIDate** . EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute . There are some nonspecific T wave abnormalities , but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes . There is some low voltage in the limb leads , though I suspect this is related to his habitus . Overall , Mr. **PHI** is a pleasant 78 year old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath . He appears to be functional class III . He does not have any **PHI** evidence of volume overload on exam today , though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal . Moreover , he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease . We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. **PHI** and his family today . We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation . However , given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3 4 month post ablation may be required to adjudicate success . Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities , we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation . We will leave this decision to them . Moreover , prior to the ablation , we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation . Thank you very much for referring Mr. **PHI** to our care . We will be in touch following the procedure . As always , feel free to call with any questions .
