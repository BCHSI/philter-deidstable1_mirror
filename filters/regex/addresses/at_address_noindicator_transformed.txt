# Regular expression to identify address of the a patient in the notes
# Looks for single or multiple numeric values followed by space, single or multiple letters, one or more white space and multiple letters after the word at in the notes
# Regex also ensures that the digits are not followed by the words bpm, ccs, cc, pm, am or noon
# Regex finally also does a negative lookahead for the pattern .m. to avoid capturing time as address
