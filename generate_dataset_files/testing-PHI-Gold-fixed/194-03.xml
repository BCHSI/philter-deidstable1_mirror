Internal Medicine Admission Note

Name: Crawford, Patrick
MR#:  9021555
Date of Admission: 04.15.94 
PCP: Ehlers, Willa
Attending: Ward
Admitting Resident: Kimberly Ring

CC: 83 y/o man w/ known CAD presenting with near syncope

HPI:  
83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am). Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.    After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea. At no point did he have chest pain. He did not lose consciousness. This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. 
In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. 
ED Course:
Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile. Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia. Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted. 

ROS: 
Negative in detail; positives noted in HPI. 

Medical History:
1. CAD: Adenosine mibi showed reversible, moderate, anteroseptal defect. Cath 10/92 with mild to moderate LAD (focal 50% stenosis in proximal third; focal 50% stenosis of mid third at ostia of second diaganol artery) and RCA (proximal RCA w/ 50% stenosis in distal third) disease; interrogation with pressure wire of LAD lesion revealed non-hemodynamically signficiant lesion. Discharged from SDU on med management (beta blocker, asa, ace, and statin), with f/u w/ Dr. Youmans (who has followed since).
2. Syncope: Admitted twice 2092, first attributed to alpha blocker and dehydration, second time ruled out, but had positive adenosine mibi (see above)
. - 	3. DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.  HbA1c checked q3mo; most recent was around 5.0 per pt.

7. Vertigo: dx in 10/2090, described as dizziness/room spinning.  No subsequent episodes.  Negative CTA of the head/neck at SOH.
8. BPH
9. Lung cancer, s/p L lobectomy (middle and lower lobes) in 2072, did not require chemotherapy or radiation
10. OA, s/p R total hip replacement (2086)
11. Gout: involves L big toe, but with rare flares
12. Glaucoma OU

ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     

Chest xray: Clear

Assessment & Plan
83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting. Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features. However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain. Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s. However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion. It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen. There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.

Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
Has completed MI r/o
Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis. Afebrile. Hemodynamically stable. U/A and chest xray negative
Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
Fen/Renal
Replete Mg
Proph: Lovenox, nexium
