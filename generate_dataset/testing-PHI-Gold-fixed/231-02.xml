Some scar. Mild LV dysfunction with EF 45-50% and apical dyskinesis.

10/94 Cath: patent LAD stents. Mid RCA lesion treated with 2.5 X 13 mm cypher stent. Discharge delayed for neurologic changes (LOC and unresponsive) but EEG, CNIS, CT, all without new infarct (old PCA CVA).

Assessment and plan:

   40 y.o. with multiple risk factors for CAD. HTN, high chol, IDDM. Previous LAD stent with restenosis. Then second LAD stent and finally RCA stent. Now with admit for NSTEMI. Transferred for urgent cath. Plan for eventual renal transplant at CVH (had been waiting for Plavix to be completed). Pre-treated with mucomyst. 



Given her previous restenosis, and the fact that further Plavix courses are postponing her renal transplant....she would be best served with CABG if she has restenosis. 



Further plan per Dr Rollins

Follow up with Dr Eaves
