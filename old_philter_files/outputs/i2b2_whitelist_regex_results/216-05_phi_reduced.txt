There was not a **PHI** to inhaled bronchodilator . The reduced FVC is consistent with **PHI** deficit . Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated . **PHI** **PHIDate** , the FEV1 and FVC have not changed . IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS DOE is likely multifactorial . It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary **PHI** from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio pulmonary exercise test to the patient , to which she agreed . In addition , as previously discussed , she would benefit from pulmonary rehab . Finally , I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture . There was no response to **PHI** today and the patient does not feel any help from it either . I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it does n't help her . I 've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the **PHI** of allergic asthma . We will not do the methacholine **PHI** testing due to patient 's already **PHI** FEV1 ( due to restriction ) as it might be dangerous to precipitate **PHI** in the setting of an already limited reserve .
