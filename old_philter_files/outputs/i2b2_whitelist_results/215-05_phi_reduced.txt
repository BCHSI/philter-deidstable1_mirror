 Record date : **PHI** CARDIOLOGY **PHI** VALLEY CLINIC Reason for visit : A **PHI** yr old IDDM man s/p CABG in **PHI** with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post **PHI** . Interval History : Cardiac history began in **PHI** with inappropriate sinus tachycardia . A cardiac echo revealed EF of **PHI** % with no valvular disease and normal wall motion . An **PHI** MIBI **PHI** revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab . The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension , **PHI** of **PHI** , co-dominance with **PHI** % PDA , moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion . HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD , radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA . **PHI** he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab . His PA pressure was **PHI** with a **PHI** of **PHI** , all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased . An **PHI** MIBI **PHI** showed an EF of **PHI** % w small PB scar & **PHI** ischemia . Echo **PHI** revealed new LA enlargement with EF of **PHI** %. He was admitted **PHI** with HF **PHI** renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient **PHI** with zaroxolyn . ( BUN **PHI** , creat **PHI** ) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of **PHI** . An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of **PHI** %. Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden **PHI** , floaters . He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as **PHI** . In addition , he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief . He has **PHI** **PHI** of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses **PHI** SL TNG prophylactically . An exercise adenosine MIBI was done **PHI** which revealed an EF of **PHI** % with mild anterior and IPL ischemia . He was admitted for a cardiac cath **PHI** , however due to a creatinine of **PHI** only a right heart cath was done . It revealed RAP of **PHI** , RVP of **PHI** , PAP of **PHI** , **PHI** of **PHI** and CO **PHI** . Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine , Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held . He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds . He is being followed by Dr You in renal service . Of note , he continues to use the oxygen at night . ( **PHI** liters NP ) Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM , TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD , mild LCX disease , RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA , VG to RCA small vessel but patent , LIMA to LAD patent . **PHI** the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic .
