Assessment/Plan:  Mr Aguilar is a 51 M with cystic fibrosis and hx of CRI who presents now with significant worsening of his renal function seen on outpatient labs as well as it having been nearly one year since prior cleanout. He is being admitted for initiation of cleanout and evaluation of renal dysfunction. He will be admitted to pulmonary PA service.


1) Pulm/ID: Based on his past sputum culture studies from CHB and his renal function we will start him on Ceftaz at renal dose of 2g q24h and cipro 250 q12h. Have used aminoglycosides in the past but given his renal function will avoid these at this time. Will get a f/u CXR to compare to his study done last year to assess for any change. Will consult RT for Chest PT TID and discuss restarting hypertonic saline/pulmozyme. Will continue other pulmonary inhalers. 



2)FEN/GI: Will maintain on high calorie, high protein CF diet and continue current regimen of vitamins and enzymes. Will get 
Nutrition consult as patient has not been seen in quite some time. Will monitor bowels, currently stable.


3) CV: history of HTN, will continue home cozaar and lisinopril for now but may consider alternative choices given renal dysfunction if needed. Will monitor vital signs.


4) ENDO: CF related DM: will continue lantus and SSI and check FSBS AC/HS. Will send HgA1c given his report of erratic control at home.


5) Rheum: Gouty arthritis has been stable, will contiue probenecid and celebrex 



6) Renal: Recent BUN/creatinine as reported from his PCP is significantly elevated from his prior levels earlier this year. Patient has not been followed regularly by nephrology in the past. Unclear the exact nature of his renal dysfunction and the etiology of its worsening of late.
