His most recent echocardiogram **PHI**, showed a severe depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with global hypokinesis and antero apical akinesis with moderate LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for CHF in **PHI**, he has done well and currently denies symptoms of orthopnea, PND or edema. 3.

He is s p cerebellar CVA, **PHI** with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but has had no new neurologic events.

Hypercholesterolemia. His most recent lipid profile is quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to 136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on **PHI**. Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past. 9. Peripheral vascular disease. He continues to have bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms of claudication. 10. Osteoarthritis. He is s p left TKR by Dr. **PHI** last year and is now doing quite well. Notably, he would require antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain. He continues to have a rectal fistula. Last year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently bleeds. He has had no recent edema in his legs. His left knee is doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh muscles. He has nocturia one time per night. He has stable impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased ability to have erections, though he can still have a partial erection. Generalized decreased energy level.
