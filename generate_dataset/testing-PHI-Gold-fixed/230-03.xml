Name:  Richard, Ulysses
Medical Record: 8913196
Attending:  Snyder

History of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.  Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.  The wound was overlying the BPG.  He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.  He has been followed in clinic.  Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.  In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.
The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes.  He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.  His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.
No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.
