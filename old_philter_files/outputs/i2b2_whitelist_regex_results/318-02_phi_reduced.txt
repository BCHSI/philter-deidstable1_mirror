The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better , and his daughter called his PCP 's office today , at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED . He has had a similar episode like this before in **PHI** of **PHI** , when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a **PHI** three day weekend when he went without dialysis ( see note in LMR by neurology consultant ). It was **PHI** at that time that his myoclonus was due to electrolyte disarray , and he was admitted to EDUCARE FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms .
