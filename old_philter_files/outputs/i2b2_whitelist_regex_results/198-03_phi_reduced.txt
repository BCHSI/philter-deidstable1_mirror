Exercise ABI 's revealed R ABI drop from **PHI** to **PHI** and L ABI drop from **PHI** to **PHI** . An MRA revealed non obstructive plaque in the common **PHI** , **PHI** % left external iliac and question of disease in right internal iliac ; **PHI** to **PHI** % common femoral and **PHI** to **PHI** % stenosis more distally with **PHI** to **PHI** % serial left SFA stenoses . He had a totally occluded anterior tibialis bilaterally with **PHI** to **PHI** % trifurcation area disease and high grade posterior tibial on the right and occluded posterior tibial on the left . **PHIDate** he was admitted with angina and ruled out for an MI . A cardiac catheterization revealed **PHI** % focal LM lesion , mid **PHI** % LAD lesion , **PHI** mid LCX , **PHI** **PHI** OM2 , **PHI** **PHI** dominant RCA distal lesion with an EF of **PHI** %.

The **PHI** was treated with PTA **PHI** **PHI** x **PHI** stent , the R EIA lesion was treated with **PHI** Blue **PHI** x **PHI** stent . **PHIDate** he was taken for peripheral angiography which revealed **PHI** % **PHI** ISR , mod sev bil IIA disease , R SFA **PHI** **PHI** , TO AT PT and **PHI** **PHI** peroneal . The proximal R SFA was treated with PTA , mid was tx with DCA PTA Since then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief . In addition , he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain .

Preliminary Cardiac Cath reports reveals TO LAD with distal LAD filling from RCA collaterals ( unchanged from previous cath ). Peripheral angiography was performed and **PHI** was performed to the **PHI** for ISR as well as Precise **PHI** stent to **PHI** and Cypher **PHI** stent to the **PHI** peroneal trunk .
