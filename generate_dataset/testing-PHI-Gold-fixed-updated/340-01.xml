CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Xia is a 53 year old woman who comes in in 
follow up. She notes that she is still having occasional sweats at 
night. She is using the clonidine but she can't take it two times a day, 
it makes her too sleepy, so she takes it about 3:30 towards the end of 
her workday and then again before she goes to bed. She is having some 
right lower back pain and otherwise is feeling well.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as noted. She is also taking the 
Cozaar which she had been taking before. 

She was called back in today as a result of labs which were done 
recently which showed hemoglobin A1C of 8.7, an elevated urine 
microalbuminuria and hypertension which needed follow up.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, she is well developed and well 
nourished in no acute distress. Blood pressure 158/116, pulse 80, weight 
166. Pupils are equal and equally reactive to light. Lids and 
conjunctiva normal. Retinal fields normal. Disks sharp. Mouth and 
pharynx without erythema or exudate. No adenopathy or tenderness in the 
submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas. 
Heart sounds: S1, S2, with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the 
right sternal border. No rub or gallop. Her chest was clear to 
auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or 
rhonchi. She was clear to percussion. She has normal bowel sounds. Her 
abdomen was soft and nontender, no mass, organomegaly, and no guarding, 
no rebound. Her extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing. She 
has no spine or flank tenderness. Her neck is supple, no bruits. Her 
skin is essentially quite dry and itchy. She has multiple dark, 
hyperpigmented, post-inflammatory scarring on her lower extremities. Her 
mouth and pharynx are without erythema or exudate. 

IMPRESSION/PLAN:
1. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is really not well controlled. I 
will add atenolol to her regimen 50mg PO q.d. She drinks one cup of 
coffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will 
occasionally have one, a scotch, on Friday or Saturday. She does not do 
drugs. She will return in three week for follow up of her blood 
pressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due. 

2. Diabetes. The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes 
but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it. Her 
creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her 
elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment. We will start her on 
Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. I expect we will need to increase this and if 
she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week. 
I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat 
or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication. I suggested 
she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is 
eating. I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry. She also 
requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with
