EKG:   septal Q wave. NSR.



CXR: no pulmonary edema.  



Head CT: 1.  There is a region of low attenuation in the left occipital

lobe which may represent a subacute infarct.  MRI of the brain with DWI would be helpful for further characterization. 2.  Right maxillary sinus and nondisplaced right orbital floor fractures, as described above. 3.  Mild atrophy and nonspecific white-matter change likely

related to microangiopathic-small vessel ischemic change. 4.  Old left thalamic infarct.





A/P:  57 yoM w/ MMP presenting with syncope and facial fracture. Appears to have recurrent syncope of unclear etiology.  Cardiac etiology would be of greatest concern given hx of CAD and chest pain, though certainly cerebrovascular disease is present given CVA history.



Plan:

1. Neuro: hx of CVA on ASA

-MRI/MRA to r/o vertebrobasilar disease

2. PULM: CPAP at night for OSA

3. COR: ROMI, interrogate pacer, holter monitor, ASA, ACE, BB, Zocor

4.ENDO: RISS

5.RENAL: gentle IVF for elevated creatinine likely pre-renal etiology

6.DISPO: SS consult. Obtain MR to see what w/u has been done for patient at SHH for syncope.
