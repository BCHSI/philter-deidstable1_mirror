History of Present Illness Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for left sided weakness starting in **PHIDate** . He was golfing at the time , and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes . The weakness involved the face , arm and leg on the left side only . He went to **PHI** Hospital , where they checked his blood pressure , and found it to be **PHI** **PHI** ( per his report ). **PHI** CT scan was performed , and he was informed that it was normal . He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA . He went to the **PHI** at **PHI** **PHI** days later , his BP was still elevated , and they started him on clonidine . They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension , but he declined . No further stroke TIA workup was performed . He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup . His weakness has greatly improved , but not back to normal . He has never had sensory changes , and no speech difficulties , anosognosia , neglect , or gait instability . He did have `` flashing lights in both eyes '' for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course , but none since then . He has never had transient monocular blindness , diplopia , or suddenly blurry vision . Past Medical History Hypertension . He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis .

Plan I have reviewed Mr. Slater 's CT scan , and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule , which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome . I have counseled him that most likely the **PHI** treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension , and to use antiplatelet agents . I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to **PHI** mg per day . In addition , he needs a work up . I have arranged for him to have CNIS , **PHI** hour Holter monitoring , and TTE with bubble study . Additionally , we should check fasting lipids . He wishes to have a PCP at FPC , and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** of the cardiology department , who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds . He will return to clinic in **PHI** **PHI** months , and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns . CC Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , FPC cardiology unit .
