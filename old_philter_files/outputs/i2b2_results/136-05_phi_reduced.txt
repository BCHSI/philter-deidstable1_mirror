She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078 . She has had a difficult time recently , she is under evaluation for a lupus like syndrome ( she has noted positivity for ANA , anti **PHI** , anti dsDNA ). She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints ( ankes , knees , hips , wrists , elbows , shoulders , neck , lumbar back ) and the muscles of her arms and legs .

She was treated for NSTEMI with ASA 325 mg X 1 , heparin gtt , IV lopressor . She had a brief episode of CP which was relieved by SL NTG and morphine . She was sent to SDU for further evaluation and treatment .

Cardiac RF = age , DM , HL , active smoking . TIMI score = 3 ( age , asa use ,+ biomarkers ). DDx = ACS ( high risk NSTEMI ), aortic dissection ( concerning elements of hx ), PE ( given cancer hx , on SERM ), or perimyocarditis ( question associated with lupus like condition ). The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE . Given her risk factors , after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan , she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease . She is currently CP free . 1 .
