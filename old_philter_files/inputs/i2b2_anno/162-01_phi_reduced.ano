 Record date **PHI** ASSOCIATED ARTHRITIS SPECIALISTS CENTER **PHI** **PHI** Identification Patient is a 53 year old markedly obese female complaining of bilateral weight knee pain. She denies any morning stiffness, any jelling phenomena. She has had no trauma or effusions in the knee. She had noted on x ray many years ago that she had had a chipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has bothered her only intermittently until this year. Last year she did go to Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt better, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height of 5 ft. 1 in., she is in pain. She has not visited a physician. She has no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but she does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some dyspepsia. She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no history of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip discomfort. She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because of the knee pain. Allergies None. Medications Occasional Advil. Past Surgical History Cholecystectomy 2064. Two c sections. Past Medical History Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, stroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease. Family History Mother is alive and well with no medical problems. Father is alive and well with no medical problems. She has 12 siblings. One sibling died of pneumonia at a young age. Another sibling has asthma. Physical Examination; She is a markedly obese female, no apparent distress. She is 5 ft. 1 in. and weighs 304 lb. Examination of joints No evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, elbows, shoulders. Bilateral hips are limited in internal external rotation but not because of pain due to obesity, bilateral knees have crepitus, but no warmth or swelling. There is some pain at extremes of flexion on the left of 110 degrees. Ankles and toes within normal limits. Please note above in the clinical history that she does not complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because of the knee pain. The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to the fact that the large blood pressure cuff did not fit around her right arm. Impression 1. Probable bilateral osteoarthritis. I will obtain plain films and have prescribed Disalcid 3 gm. a day p.r.n. GI and renal side effects explained. **PHI** 2. We discussed seriously the need for weight loss. She will be referred to the nutritionist to get on a weight loss program. She will seriously entertain a weight loss program. Patient will return in a few months unless she has any further problems. 3. I have referred her to an Internal Medicine doctor for health maintenance since she does not have one as yet. **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** DD **PHI** DT **PHI** DV **PHI**
