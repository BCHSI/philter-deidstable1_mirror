Of note , pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK ( **PHI** ) at which time she presented with similar complaints of **PHI** and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC ( **PHI** ) and low Hct ( **PHI** ). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli . She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of **PHI** . Outpatient f/u abd CT ( **PHI** ) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection . Since that time , however , pt &# **PHI** ; s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility . Patient has no complaints . Specifically , she denies fatigue , chest pain , shortness of breath , dizziness , motor weakness and fevers and chills . However , given concern on the part of her sons , pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED . In the MEDIQUIK ED , she was afebrile with HR **PHI** , BP **PHI** , RR **PHI** , and **PHI** **PHI** % RA .

A/P : **PHI** with sarcoidosis , HTN , CHF , HOCM , PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin , PVD s/p L BKA , and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several **PHI** . **PHI** . Failure to thrive / lethargy : The etiology of this pt &# **PHI** ; s lethargy is unclear . It is notable , however , that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be **PHI** with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection . At present , there is no clear source of infection , although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI . Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection , but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile . In addition to bacteremia , UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection , other possible causes of her lethargy include **PHI** causes ( such as uremia ), anemia , or depression . - F/u blood , urine , and respiratory cultures - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis ( If we were to start abx , would recommend **PHI** given micro history )- Culture if spikes - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and **PHI** &# **PHI** ; t clinically improve **PHI** . Anemia &# **PHI** ; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past . During last admission , pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy . GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy . It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive . - Type and screen - Will transfuse **PHI** unit of **PHI** and monitor for clinical improvement - Check post-transfusion Hct **PHI** . HTN &# **PHI** ; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents - Per pharmacy recommendations , holding propranolol given h/o SOB - Continue clonidine , **PHI** and **PHI** ( titrate as needed ) **PHI** . Elevated INR &# **PHI** ; pt has a supratherapeutic INR . Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission , do not feel that she is actively bleeding . As such , do not feel the need to actively reverse her . - Monitor daily **PHI** - Hold warfarin overnight **PHI** . Renal insufficiency &# **PHI** ; Cr **PHI** today ( baseline **PHI** ). Likely secondary to prerenal - Fluid resuscitation - Recheck lytes in AM **PHI** . Diabetes - **PHI** **PHI** + HS - Lantus + RISS **PHI** . FEN - Diabetic diet **PHI** .
