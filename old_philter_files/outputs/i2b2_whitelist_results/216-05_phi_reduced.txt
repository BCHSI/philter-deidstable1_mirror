As you know , she is a pleasant **PHI** yo woman with h/o asthma , recurrent DVT on coumadin , breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy **PHI** years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast , DM , HTN , HLP , anemia and hypothyroidism who is being **PHI** at the CL for exertional dyspnea since **PHI** when she fell and **PHI** a compression fracture . Her other **PHI** **PHI** include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies . She has no chest pain , PND or LE edema . Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and ( mild ) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively . She has had a negative cardiac stress test . PMH as above Meds : synthroid , labetalol , norvasc , glipizide , coumadin , erythropoetin , pravastatin , ultram , albuterol , pentasa Allergies : PCN , cephalosporins , **PHI** , shellfish SH : no tobacco ever . She is a professional tool maker . She has a dog FH : asthma , CAD , DM , HTN ROS : as per HPI , otherwise negative in detail EXAM : HR **PHI** , BP **PHI** , **PHI** % RA , Wt **PHI** OP clear Lungs CTAB Heart RRR Abdomen soft NTND 1+ LE edema , no clubbing **PHI** , **PHI** Date : **PHI** **PHI** Health Center Pulmonary Function Laboratory **PHI** A Street **PHI** , Arkansas **PHI** Phone :( **PHI** ) **PHI** Fax :( **PHI** ) **PHI** Medical Director : Yvonne X.

There was not a **PHI** to inhaled bronchodilator . The reduced FVC is consistent with **PHI** deficit . Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated . **PHI** , the FEV1 and FVC have not changed . IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS : DOE is likely multifactorial . It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary **PHI** from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient , to which she agreed . In addition , as previously discussed , she would benefit from pulmonary rehab . Finally , I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture . There was no response to **PHI** today and the patient does not feel any help from it either . I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it does n't help her . I 've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the **PHI** of allergic asthma . We will not do the methacholine **PHI** testing due to patient 's already **PHI** FEV1 ( due to restriction ) as it might be dangerous to precipitate **PHI** in the setting of an already limited reserve .
