 Record date **PHI** Westwing Place Nursing Home **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**, KY **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** REASON FOR VISIT Follow up coronary disease and diabetes. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 1. The patient underwent an angioplasty on **PHI** and comes in today having just had a stress test. Stress test showed that she was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122 60, stopped for fatigue. Immediately after exercise, she did have some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery. There were no EKG changes. The patient reports that she has been walking and has resumed her normal pre hospitalization exercise level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had precipitated the hospitalization initially. She is looking into cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this. She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen. She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a healthy lifestyle. She has returned to work. She has follow up scheduled with Dr. **PHI** in two days' time. 2. Diabetes At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her Glucophage 2000 mg a day. She monitors blood sugars but only in the morning. Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s. However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically sweating and abdominal discomfort. She has never actually checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to occur at work. She has not had any fainting or dizziness. 3. Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia. 4. Hypertension. At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose because her blood pressure was quite low at 100 64, and currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued. CURRENT MEDICATIONS Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d., atenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Pravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage 500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric coated aspirin. DRUG ALLERGIES None. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.

Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. IMPRESSION AND PLAN 1. Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty with stenting. Maintaining current medications of Dr. **PHI**. At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac rehab, and we will defer that decision to him. 2. Diabetes, seems as though her control is impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet. We will discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks. 3. Elevated cholesterol. We will check on lipid status in four weeks' time. On current medications with target of LDL less than 100. 4. Hypertension.
