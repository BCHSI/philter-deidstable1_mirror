 Record date **PHI** CARDIOLOGY **PHI** MEDICAL CENTER Reason for visit Follow up visit visit Interval History **PHI** year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in **PHI** **PHI** with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST segment elevation . Known risk factors at that time ( in addition to his age and gender ) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking . Details of that presentation as per my **PHIDate** office note . Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory , one in the **PHI** RCA and two in the PLV . The PLV lesions each received **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** ( bare metal stents ) and the distal RCA lesion received a **PHI** **PHI** Vision ( bare metal stent ). A non dominant Left Circumflex had a **PHI** % stenosis that was not **PHI** upon . There was non obstructive disease in the LAD . A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of **PHI** % and no wall motion abnormalities . Left atrium was slightly dilated to **PHI** . RV function was normal . He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program ( see below ). He had an outpatient ETT MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease . He had this on **PHIDate** and he **PHI** for **PHI** minutes , **PHI** METS and achieved a heart rate **PHI** % of predicted . He did not experience chest pain , had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue . The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia . LV EF **PHI** %. He had a recurrent episode of chest pain ( somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like ) and presented to the ED in **PHI** . His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT MIBI in which he **PHI** for **PHI** mins **PHI** sec , achieving **PHI** METS , **PHI** % **PHI** , peak double product **PHI** . A different type of chest pain **PHI** during the study and was not study limiting . The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal , without evidence of ischemia or infarction . LV EF **PHI** %. He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI . He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab . He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI , and has **PHI** abstinent since then . He **PHI** normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath . His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain . Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain . This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time . Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG . He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work , and **PHI** if the pain may have been caused by those activities ( i.e . **PHI** in nature ). He has **PHI** **PHI** of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath , which has not changed since the onset of the CP . He is unsure how the character **PHI** to that of his previous MI , and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in **PHI** that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test . He denies lightheadedness or syncope . No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling . He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen . He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of **PHI** home CPAP therapy . He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes . Past medical history **PHI** ) CAD status post inferior STEMI **PHIDate** with **PHI** bare metal stents to RCA territory ( **PHI** in distal RCA and two in the PLV ). Known residual LCx **PHI** % lesion in a small , non dominant vessel **PHI** ) Hypertension **PHI** ) **PHI** **PHI** ) Former smoker quit at the time of his MI **PHI** ) Ankylosing spondylitis **PHI** ) Thrombophlebitis of the left leg , report of DVT in other notes Changes to Allergies NKA No Known Allergies reaction [ reviewed ] Medications ( Confirmed ) ASA Lipitor 20mg po daily lisinopril **PHI** mg po daily Niaspan Plavix 75mg po daily Toprol XL **PHI** mg PO daily Physical examination Pulse **PHI** regular weight **PHI** lbs .

Assessment and plan **PHI** year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI **PHIDate** treated with **PHI** bare metal stents to the RCA territory , Hypertension , Hyperlipidemia , and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention **PHI** for his coronary disease , although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days . **PHI** ) Coronary artery disease Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory , and he has now completed over a **PHI** month course of Plavix therapy . Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs ( i.e . Motrin ), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point . He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily , Lipitor 20mg daily , Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily . His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled . The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to **PHI** when he had an ETT MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images . He does have a known **PHI** % stenosis in a non dominant LCx , but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory . His ECG today is unchanged from **PHI** . However , given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms . I will call the patient in several days time , and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT . **PHI** ) Secondary prevention Most recent Lipid panel in **PHIDate** on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC **PHI** , LDL **PHI** , HDL **PHI** and **PHI** **PHI** . His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several **PHI** . Given this , along with an elevated TG value , we will start Niaspan . He can start with **PHI** mg qhs for the first **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** to help get through the common adverse effects ( i.e . flushing ). He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin **PHI** minutes before to help minimize side effects . After a few **PHI** , he can increase to the maintenance dose of **PHI** mg qhs . He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward . He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level . **PHI** ) Hypertension Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily . He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure .
