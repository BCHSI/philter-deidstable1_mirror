  Return visit.  Reason for visit: 73 year old male for evaluation/management multiple
  issues.  
  
  Diabetes: he is on maximal dose of glipizide and Glucophage and A1C has been going up
  steadily now to 8.0.  His sugars vary greatly in the morning from 100 to 174.  He hasn't
  been checking pre dinner.  We discussed insulin and he really is quite against it.  We will
  continue discussion open.  Asked him to check pre dinner sugars.  
  
  Coronary disease: patient had a mild posterior ischemia in 2112 on a screening stress test. 
  He is actually having some progressive dyspnea on exertion and a sense of chest
  tightness with one block.  He is a bit of a denier.  He hasn't tried nitroglycerin, which I
  have given him.  I suggested he do that.  He will have a follow up stress test and we will
  arrange a cardiology consult.  
  
  UTI: patient had an E coli UTI 9/13.  He doesn't really have much in terms of other
  prostate symptoms and no nocturia.  He has however, developed urinary urgency again in
  the last week or two.  Will check another culture.  May need urology referral.  
  
  Knee pain: patient with longstanding DJD of the knees.  Will have a consult at Christiana Hospital considering replacement.  
  
  Family history: unchanged.   
  
  Review of systems: status post an embolic stroke in 2111 and took warfarin for 2 years
  and followed by Dr. Dillon.  He is still on Celexa for depression.  He is having hearing
  loss with equivocal audiograms.  Suggested otology consult at Naples Community Hospital.  He has
  a mild hypoproliferative anemia that is stable.  Sleep apnea.  All other systems negative. 
  
  Physical exam: his weight is 196 pounds.  Most recent 195.  BP was 140/70.  Pulse 60. 
  Skin normal.  Nodes: none.  Chest clear lungs.  Cardiac: S1, S2 normal.  Grade II/VI
  systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation (confirmed by echo).  Abdomen no mass or
  organomegaly.  Extremities: mild venous stasis.  Trace edema.  DP pulses are 1+.
