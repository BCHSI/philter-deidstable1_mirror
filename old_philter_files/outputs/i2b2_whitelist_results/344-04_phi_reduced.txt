 Record date : **PHI** Neurology resident consult note Patient Name : **PHI** MRN : **PHI** Date : **PHI** Consult reason :? abnormal gait HPI : **PHI** who going to bed Wednesday was in **PHI** , but Thursday **PHI** awoke w/ terrible HA , so came to ED ; got CT head and LP , both negative for blood . However , BP was reportedly as high as **PHI** ( and wife says she &# **PHI** ; s measured it this high at home at least once in past **PHI** **PHI** ), and blood glucose **PHI** . I see no LMR note about the visit , but am told that he was given some medication for his BP , given some insulin and a Rx for insulin , and instructed to see his PCP the next day , and discharged . Friday he did see his PCP , who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead , and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA , so he came back to the **PHI** ED tonight . He was given caffeine , ibuprofen , Tylenol , and compazine , reported that his HA was gone . However , a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait . An MRI was originally ordered , but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that **PHI** MRI . Neurology is now **PHI** comment on his gait and other sx . Patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline , and has been as it is for years ; they have **PHI** no change and have no complaints . He is very unpleasant and **PHI** about his history , slow to cooperate w/ exam ; says he wants to go home , resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone .

Reflexes : absent throughout . Cerebellar : **PHI** , rapid alternating movements , **PHI** normal and symmetric b/l . Gait : Slightly wide based . Normal arm swing , normal speed . Able to walk on toes and heels . Some difficulty w/ tandem walk . Negative Romberg . A/P : **PHI** w/ HTN urgency yesterday , newly diagnosed DM w/ FS in **PHI** yesterday , who yesterday presented w/ new HA and negative **PHI** for SAH , now back again for same HA , which has finally resolved in apparently in concert w/ some improvement in BP ( current BP **PHI** ) and w/ medications . Neurology was specifically **PHI** for his gait , which does appear a bit wide-based , but he and wife confirm that this is chronic , and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems . Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN , which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA , and his uncontrolled DM , of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education . In any case , I find no acute neurological issues . **PHI** : -BP management -DM management . Thanks for this interesting consult . **PHI** discussed w/ KEKELA neurology attending by phone , Dr. **PHI** Guy . Call w/ questions **PHI** . **PHI** **PHI** , MD , PhD , Neurology resident **PHI** Addendum : He did not mention this when I **PHI** him and wife about PMH , but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH : A note from Dr. **PHI** Irish , neurosurgery , from **PHI** notes that he is s/p &# **PHI** ; cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum . He is doing much better today . He states that his headaches are considerably better , and the left hemibody **PHI** are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin.&# **PHI** ;
