Compared with **PHI** -- the QRS complex is slightly **PHI** . Impression Sternal pain -- non-exertional , reproducible by palpation , and not accompanied by ECG changes -- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago . Sx are different from his original anginal pain -- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site . No sign , currently , of local or systemic infection . Doubt pneumonia ( no cough or fever , lungs clear ) or GI cause . Pericarditis a possibility ( he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG ), but no signs on ECG , and the pain is not positional . Discussed the case with the pt 's cardiologist , Dr. **PHI** **PHI** -- and we came up with the following plan : Plan - will send **PHI** x **PHI** -- although cards **PHI** that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low - check CXR - send ESR , **PHI** - OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done - will contact Dr. **PHI** 's service ( cardiac surgery ) and Dr. **PHI** ( PCP ) to make them aware - instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain , SOB , fever , or **PHI** over the lower sternum **PHI** **PHI** M **PHI** , M.D .
