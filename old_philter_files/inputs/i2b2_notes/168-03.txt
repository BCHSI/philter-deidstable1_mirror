SMH 0189233

SDU Admission: 04/27/73



PCP: Elliott

Cards: Alston



Chief complaint

Chest pain



History of present illness

54 year old man with DM1 for >40 years, ESRD on HD, CAD, s/p PCI at VHOC and Sipher stent to LAD (100% lesion) on 4/10. Discharged on heart failure regimen. Developed chest pain last night, pleuritic, different than previous CP. No ECG changes noted in EW, went to Alina Medical where symptoms changed abruptly to 8/10 SSC pressure that was similar to pain experienced at VHOC admission.ECG showed biphasic TWI in anterior precordium V1-V3, and    saddle-shaped    T waves, ST elevations in II/III/aVF. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.2. Patient moved to cath lab for urgent re-look.



In the cath lab, found a widely patent LAD stent with post-stend 40% eccentric plaque. D1 ostial pinch from stent. RCA and LCx patent. No intervention. Transferred to SDU. Currently without chest pain, pressure or discomfort.

CONCLUSIONS



  Due to the presence of vascular calcification artifact, segmental pressure

measurements could not be obtained.  The pulse volume recordings,

however, were normal.

Conclusion:     

 

1. Normal left ventricular size with moderate concentric left ventricular

   hypertrophy.  Overall systolic function is mildly reduced with an estimated

   ejection fraction of 42%.  There is severe anterior and anteroseptal

   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.  No left ventricular thombus is

   detected.  

2. Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.

3. Borderline left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.

4. The aortic valve is trileaflet with normal leaflet excursion.  No

   significant aortic stenosis or insufficiency is detected.  

5. The aortic root appears normal in size.

6. The mitral valve appears morphologically normal, without prolapse.  There is

   trace mitral regurgitation.   

7. Normal tricuspid valve, without detected regurgitation.  Right ventricular

   systolic pressure could not be estimated due to insufficient tricuspid

   regurgitation.

8. There is no significant pulmonic insufficiency.

9. No significant pericardial effusion.  The inferior vena cava appears normal.

Assesment/Plan

54 year old with high risk cardiac risk factors, s/p recent PCI of LAD with  recurrent CP, and a cath showing a blocked small diagonals that cannot be opened. Plan for maximal medical management. In addition, he has many other medical problems, including continuing therapy for a +PPD,



Ischemia

-	clopidogrel, ASA

-	Atorvastatin

-	Add isordil when BP allows

-	Would benefit from ACE-I, follow BP and add as tolerated





HTN

-	norvasc

-	ACE-I

-	Question h/o problems with BBs given asthma, check with Dr. Elliott, but would also be a good drug to use



ESRD/HD

-	call HD fellow for dialysis next week

-	nephrocaps

-	watch K, PO4

-	nephrocaps



DM

-	continue home NPH dose

-	RISS

-	CV/DM diet

-	Gabapentin for neuropathy



PPD

-	continue rifampin



Prophylaxis

-	fragmin 2500 qd

-	esomeprazole 20 qd

-	OOB as soon as possible
