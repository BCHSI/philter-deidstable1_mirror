At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent burning pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs feet. This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side. In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral burning pain that began in both feet. Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping. Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees. She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness). Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom. A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called. In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R sided hydronephrosis. Labetolol diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI. She has never had burning pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year. Of note, she has had years of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees. She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd 4th digits. ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation (1 BM 2days). She denies fever chills sweats, recent weight loss, fatigue, hypoglycemic episodes, cough rhinorrhea sore throat, SOB, orthpnea, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria polydipsia.

She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally. Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout. This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR CRP). Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated. However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.

The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one handed sterile lateral approach. 1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella. A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn. A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. **PHI**, and Dr. **PHI**. Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed. Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis. **PHI**, MS4 x **PHI** Addendum Patient seen, records reviewed, case reviewed with medical student.
