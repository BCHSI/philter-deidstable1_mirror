PATIENT: Hendricks, Hannah

MRN: 75322175

Attending: Shea



CC: L foot pain



HPI:  52 y/o F with Hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, s/p R fem-pop bypass and L fem-DP bypass, both in 2066.  She was doing well until April 2078, when she presented with a non-healing ulcer and gangrene in her L third toe and subsequently underwent a redo L fem-anterior tibial bypass using R basilic and cephalic veins on 5/3/78.  On 6/11/78 she had graft scanning, which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and ankle-brachial indices at that time were normal bilaterally.  However, she presented on 9/17/78 c/o L foot pain.  On physical exam, she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  She now presents with increasing pain, &#8220;32&#8221; on scale 0-10 that is constant in nature, with occasional sharp spikes in intensity.  She also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the L foot, but there is no paresthesia.  She denies CP, SOB, N/V, flank pain, or any urinary Sx and has no history of cardiac disease.

Patent arterial bypass graft with no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis.

                

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.  On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.  In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.  The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.



- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin

- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan

- NPO from midnight, pepcid

- check chem7, CBC, coags

- has an insulin pump

- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

Patient seen and examined. Agree with medical student note above. Briefly, 52yF with DM I, HTN, hyperlipidemia s/p bilateral revascularization procedures for PVD presents with complaints of left foot pain limiting walking to several feet as well as with small ulcers on her toes. ABIs are very diminished on the left and graft scan shows elevated velocities at proximal anastomosis. She is admitted in anticipation of angiography in am. 

N: Cont oxycodone, neurontin

CV: Cont home meds

Resp: F/u final CXR read

GI: Diabetic diet; NPO after MN

GU: D5 &#189; NS @ 100 after MN; foley to be placed at 6AM

Heme: SQH 

ID: No issues

Endo: Patient has insulin pump and knows to adjust this when she is NPO 

Other: Consent for angiogram in chart

Discussed with Dr. Weller, vascular chief resident, who agrees with assessment and plan.
