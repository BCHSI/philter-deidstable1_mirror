                                                                                                                                   LMC# 100-57-08










Flexible sigmoidoscopy to 25 cm (sigmoid) normal except mild diverticulosis.  



IMPRESSION:

Large symptomatic hemorrhoids.  They are too big for office treatment.  Therefore discussed the option of hemorrhoidectomy, which would probably give her a nice result.  She wishes to think about it for now, however, which is fine.  In the meantime, gave her info brochure plus instructions in conservative RX hemorrhoids.
