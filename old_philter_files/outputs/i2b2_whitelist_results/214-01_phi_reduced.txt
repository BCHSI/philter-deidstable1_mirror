He left **PHI** City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina . While taking an afternoon walk in **PHI** during early **PHI** he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis ; pain radiated to the left upper arm and patient **PHI** it as `` **PHI** burning pressure ''. He went back home and rest **PHI** the pain he estimates within **PHI** minutes . There days later pain **PHI** , again it lasted about **PHI** minutes but this time he went to ED . An EKG was `` normal '' and he was discharged on NG . Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones , he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized . On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have `` diffuse CAD '' involving several vessels . Stent placement was not attempted . His LV EF was **PHI** % and he was transferred to a medical **PHI** . A day later , on July 3rd , he was **PHI** to the ICU because of CP ; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July **PHI** on the following medication : ASA **PHI** mg Plavix **PHI** mg po qd Bisoprolol 5mg po qd Isosorbide **PHI** mg one po in am **PHI** po in pm Ranitidine **PHI** mg po qd Lipitor **PHI** mg po qd A sleeping medication **PHI** mg ? Lexotan one po hs Metformin **PHI** mg po bid Mr. **PHI** has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was **PHI** himself to come to the hospital . He then experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes . It is worth **PHI** that ETT here in **PHI** was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was was read as not suggestive of ischemia : Testing performed : STRESS ECHO , DOPPLER , COLOR DOPPLER **PHI** : 2D Quality : Conclusion : **PHI** . Patient **PHI** **PHI** min **PHI** sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol , reaching stage **PHI** , and stopped secondary to fatigue . No chest pain was reported . Maximal heart rate **PHI** was **PHI** bpm ( **PHI** % of maximum HR predicted for age ), and BP at peak exercise was **PHI** . The maximum **PHI** product was **PHI** . See exercise report for full ECG details . Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm . There were **PHI** mm **PHI** ST depressions in leads **PHI** and lead II at peak **PHI** . Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals : Normal left ventricular size and systolic function . Estimated resting ejection fraction is **PHI** %. No resting segmental wall motion abnormalities . Trace mitral **PHI** . Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise reveal : Normal increase in overall systolic function , with an estimated ejection fraction of & gt ; **PHI** %. All segments augment normally , without inducible wall motion **PHI** : No **PHI** evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia , **PHI** less than target heart rate ( which **PHI** the sensitivity of **PHI** ) .ATTENDING STAFF : **PHI** , **PHI** V., M.D., PH.D . Mr. **PHI** has Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in **PHI** which **PHI** in right hemiparesis ( now fully resolved ) who was last seen in January .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : A **PHI** gentleman with a history of **PHI** diabetes and CVA who has new onset of exertional angina who was catheterized in **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** ago .

Plan : Consult Cardiology ASAP meanwhile check BP , Lipids , CBC , TSH , MA and alt ast . Nitroglycerine prescription renewed . Continue present regimen . Patient instructed to call and come to ED if he experiences CP . However he lives in **PHI** and driving in can take some time . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
