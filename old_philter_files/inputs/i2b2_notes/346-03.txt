Reason for Visit

Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.  We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.  He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.  He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.  Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.  He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.  His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.  I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.  He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.  He is worried about his remaining vision.  He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.  She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.  He also is having trouble sleeping.  He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.  He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.  He does take naps in the afternoon at times.
