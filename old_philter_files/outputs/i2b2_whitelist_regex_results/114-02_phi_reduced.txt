 Record date **PHI** Personal Data and Overall Health **PHI** year old S P L internal capsule stroke **PHIDate** . Reason for Visit Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up . I last saw him on **PHIDate** , and he has continued to **PHI** that time . He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention , and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension . He has had no new stroke like symptoms , and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak , usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued . He was recently seen by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** of the department of Cardiology . He underwent a **PHI** hour holter monitor , which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia . His CNIS have no evidence for disease . He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today . Medications PROPRANOLOL ( PROPRANOLOL HCL ) 40MG PO BID x **PHI** days Start Date **PHIDate** Stop Date **PHIDate** ATENOLOL 50MG **PHI** Tablet ( s ) PO QD Start Date **PHIDate** NORVASC ( AMLODIPINE ) 2.5MG **PHI** Tablet ( s ) PO QD Start Date **PHIDate** Exam Alert , Ox3 . Speech fluent , non dysarthric . EOM 's full , no nystagmus . Face symmetric , full power x **PHI** . No drift . Gait steady , narrow based . Plan I am pleased with his negative results so far ( **PHI** hour holter , CNIS ), and I doubt the TTE will change our management . We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule . The **PHI** for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day , and continued treatment for his hypertension , as per Dr. **PHI** . I will see him again in **PHI** months time , and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions . CC Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , FPC Cardiology Unit
