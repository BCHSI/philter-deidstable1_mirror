	Reason for visit:
    s/p cath


	Interval History:
   Per HPI J. Jordan Duran:

64 y.o. male with known CAD. He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095. At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling. He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally. He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes. 

He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA. His ejection fraction at that time was 40%. He was referred for surgery. He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1. 

He now presents with recurrent chest burning. He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG. His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest. He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis. During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test. Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds. He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved. MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility. There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct. His ejection fraction is 46%. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending. Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod. ostial stenosis, LIMA-LAD 100%, LM mild, LAD severe w/ distal 100%, LCx OM 100%. Plan is for med management.

  BB increased today since pt. never increased as OP-cont. to monitor labile b/p.  On statin, ASA, ACE I, prn sl NTG.
Lipids, LFTs in am.
CBC, lytes, BUN, Cr in am.
