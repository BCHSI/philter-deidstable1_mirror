 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**, M.D. Obstetrics Callaway District Hospital **PHI** **PHI** AL **PHI** RE **PHI** CDH# **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** Thank you for referring **PHI** for evaluation of her atrial fibrillation. Mrs. **PHI** is 55 years old. Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and underwent endometrial biopsy in **PHI** followed by total abdominal hysterectomy in early **PHI**. Her post operative course was complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late **PHI** and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm. The episode was accompanied by some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of any palpitations. She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had any symptomatic recurrences. Her abdominal incision is open but healing and she has been recovering well. She has no prior cardiac history. She specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient neurologic symptoms. She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs. She feels that her exertional capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she stopped smoking. She does not have a known history of hypertension, however VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy with verapamil. There is no prior history of syncope. Page Two RE **PHI** CDH# **PHI** **PHI** Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin. She has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications. She previously smoked two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without any particular change in her health precipitating this. She rarely drinks ethanol. She has not had any prior surgeries. Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease. Review of systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last admission. Physical examination reveals a healthy appearing obese woman sitting comfortably with a blood pressure of 140 90, heart rate 73 and regular. HEENT is externally unremarkable. There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly. Carotids are palpable bilaterally. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac exam reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical impulse. There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a healing surgical incision in the lower abdomen. Extremities are without edema. Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily palpable. The 12 lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval of .18, QRS .08. There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis. An echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy. My impression is that Ms. **PHI** has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in the perioperative period. She probably has mild labile hypertension which has not been previously treated. This would explain her electrocardiographic changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to atrial fibrillation. I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily. Once her incision is further healed we will arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance regarding the possible co existence of coronary artery disease in view of her mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation. Page Three RE **PHI** CDH# **PHI** **PHI** will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise tolerance test. We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid. We also gave her a prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation. Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care. Sincerely, **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
