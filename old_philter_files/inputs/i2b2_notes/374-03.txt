Abdominal CT Renal no hydronephrosis/renal masses.
Dilated loops of bowel/ no masses/ consistent with SBO

Assessment and plan:
Patient with recurrent SBO. Unfortunately she has had vomiting X 4-5 days, and now has acute renal failure, most likely due to hypotension, dehydration and ATN

Her psychiatric problem is significant. 
Hold HCTZ/ ACE
IV hydration. Renal consult.
NG suction for SBO.
Dr Xenakis back tomorrow.
