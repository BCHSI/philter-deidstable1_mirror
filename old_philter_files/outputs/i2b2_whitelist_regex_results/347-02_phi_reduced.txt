IDENTIFICATION This is my first medical visit with this **PHI** year old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS She has a **PHI** history of severe cerebrovascular disease , with multiple **PHI** . She has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation . Past right carotid endarterectomy . In **PHI** **PHI** , she was admitted to BMH with a right cerebellar stroke , complicated by a brief intubation and pneumonia . She underwent stenting of her right vertebral artery and left common carotid artery . She had subsequent episodes of worsening speech , and was started on Coumadin , with an INR goal of **PHI** to **PHI** . She is followed closely by Neurology and may , at some point , undergo further interventional radiology procedures , to be determined . During her most recent hospitalization she had some confusion which was attributed to low sodium . This was felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis , and possible SIADH . This is being treated with salt tablets , saline boluses in her G tube , water restriction , and low dose Lasix . No evidence of adrenal insufficiency . Since leaving the hospital , she has had ongoing weight loss . Baseline weight **PHI** pounds . Weight in early **PHI** , **PHI** pounds . Weight **PHI** 20th , **PHI** pounds . Weight **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** pounds . Weight today in clinic **PHI** pounds on our scale . She had a swallowing study on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , which revealed no aspiration , but very poor bolus formation . The G tube was placed in **PHI** , and has healed well , but has never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis . Over the past couple of **PHI** , she has worsening trouble with coughing , choking and **PHI** , as she attempts to swallow . Her caloric p.o . intake sounds as if it has been quite minimal , with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed foods here and there . She is drinking two or three can of booster Ensure daily , but clearly not meeting her caloric needs . Today 's visit was with the patient , and her daughter ( phone number **PHI** ). Most recent laboratory studies , done **PHIDate** Sodium **PHI** , potassium **PHI** , chloride **PHI** , Bicarb **PHI** , BUN **PHI** , creatinine **PHI** , calcium **PHI** , glucose **PHI** . The patient has felt increasingly weak and **PHI** , as her weight has decreased . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Also remarkable for slight bright red blood per rectum within the last week . The patient's daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in early **PHI** , at the **PHI** Area Community Hospital . The patient 's daughter will bring me these records at the next visit . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY **PHI** . Cerebrovascular disease , as noted above . **PHI** . Throat cancer in early **PHI** .

Her daughter **PHI** is a Food Service Supervisor . Another daughter is staying with the patient full time . Visiting nurse is involved . Previous to the last few months , the patient was fairly independent . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION GENERAL Cachectic , anxious woman , who is slightly unsteady on her feet , but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly and carefully . Has a cane , but does not always use it . VITAL SIGNS BP **PHI** **PHI** , initially ( patient very anxious ), and **PHI** **PHI** on repeat . Pulse **PHI** . Weight **PHI** pounds , fully **PHI** . ABDOMEN With good bowel sounds . Soft , nontender and **PHI** . No hepatosplenomegaly . No masses . G tube is flushed with water , and flushes easily . G tube site itself is well healed and nontender , with no pussy discharge . LUNGS Clear to auscultation . HEART Regular rate and rhythm . No murmurs . ASSESSMENT AND PLAN **PHI** . Weight loss . Probably due to poor caloric intake . This is a significant health concern for her , as she has become progressively cachectic and weak . This is probably attributed to , by some extent , her progressive dysphagia . She is referred **PHI** to Nutrition , and will see them on Tuesday . I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple of **PHI** , to get her muscle mass up , and then reevaluate . She should continue to take p.o . foods as tolerated , but she needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G tube , since she is clearly not meeting it p.o . Will try Glucerna because of her diabetes history . The patient 's daughter and the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and Coumadin , and they will discuss this further when she sees Nutrition Clinic in two days . **PHI** . Cerebrovascular disease . Followed closely by Neurology . No acute change in neuro status today . Will continue Coumadin . Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for this . Recent INR **PHI** . Will adjust Coumadin as advised by IM nurse . **PHI** . SIADH . I need to review these records more closely , and try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder . In the meantime , her **PHI** have been quite good recently . **PHI** . Diabetes . Recent hyperglycemia , with sugars in the **PHI** to **PHI** range . Most recently , with sugars in the **PHI** to **PHI** range over the past few days . Continue glyburide **PHI** mg p.o . b.i.d . Finger sticks three to four times daily . Further adjustments PRN . Our current goal is simply to maintain her sugars between **PHI** and approximately **PHI** to **PHI** . Once her dietary issues are stabilized , we can aim for slightly **PHI** control . Wish to avoid hypoglycemia , given her **PHI** with p.o . intake . **PHI** . Recent history of bright red blood per rectum . Daughter will bring me her recent colonoscopy report , and we will take it from there . **PHI** . Constipation . Continue Colace . Add Dulcolax PRN . Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse . If she does have chronic constipation , this may impact her appetite and her ability to eat successfully . **PHI** . Hypertension . Currently in reasonable control . Goal BP **PHI** to **PHI** , systolic . Initial severe hypertension this visit , attributed to anxiety , which clearly is a major issue for her . Follow up at next visit . **PHI** . Anxiety . Followed by Psychiatry . Extensive reassurance given today to the patient . She is very concerned about her weight loss , as am I. I tried to reassure her that we would take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion . Addendum spoke with psych they will start paxil **PHI** mg qd watch for worsening SIADH and or **PHI** side effects . **PHI** . Multiple other issues . To be addressed at further visits . Given her weight loss and complexity , I will see her on a weekly basis for the next few **PHI** , or sooner PRN . Daughter has my pager number , and knows how to reach me . **PHI** Yale , M.D .
