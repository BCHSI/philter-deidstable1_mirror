CHIEF COMPLAINT
: 
hyperglycemia






HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS





            Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia.  His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.  Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.  He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.  He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.  His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.  An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).  His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.  Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.  He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.

            On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.  He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.  He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.

A/P
: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia


#) Hyperglycemia:
 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS. Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ? underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).  No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).  Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.  Current FSBG 330.  Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN




#) A-fib:
 New onset a-fib.  Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).  CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.  Currently rate-controlled 80s.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.  Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.  On ASA.  Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.



#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease. 
Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.




#) Edema
: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc). 
Given duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc. w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.




#) Bullous pemphigoid
: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks. 
Will contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.




#) HTN
: Currently well-controlled.  Continue doxazosin 2 mg qHS, HCTZ 12.5 PO daily

Aliskiren/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and clonidine 0.2 mg PO BID.  Monitor and add additional agents as needed




#) Chronic kidney disease: Cr slightly above baseline, but improving with hydration.  Will monitor.  No current indications for renal replacement therapy.



#) 
? PNA:  Afebrile and asymptomatic (no cough, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, or left shift).  Will hold antibiotics.



#) Gout: cont. allopurinol (redosed for renal function)



#) FEN: Diabetic diet



#) PPX: GI: PPI; PCP: bactrim; Bowel: none; Steroids: vit D; DVT: heparin
