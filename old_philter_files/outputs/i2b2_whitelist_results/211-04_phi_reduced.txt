He underwent RCA stenting at that time , **PHI** the RV marginal with sluggish flow **PHI** . Post MI ECHO showed EF of **PHI** % **PHI** HK . He underwent f/u ETT **PHI** in **PHI** which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia . EF at that time was **PHI** %. He has done reasonably well since then . In late spring , Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina , but markedly less severe , which occurred with exertion . He had a repeat ETT **PHI** . EKG was positive for ischemia . Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia . His meds were **PHI** , but his symptoms have **PHI** . Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA . Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded , with **PHI** LCX lesions . His LCX was stented with **PHI** **PHI** ( **PHI** **PHI** and **PHI** x **PHI** ) with good results . He was put on **PHI** and transferred to Cardiology where he **PHI** pain free and in no distress .
