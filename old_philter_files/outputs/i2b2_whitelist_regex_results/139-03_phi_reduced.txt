Reviewed x rays , which were negative for fracture of frontal facial bones , and did not reveal obvious abnormality in the TMJ area .

Has never been interested in counseling prior to today . Did not become tearful like she has in the past . Asked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin . Prescription apparently was given to her last spring . Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness . No clear to me what causes her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine , but says when she takes it , it relieves her symptoms .
