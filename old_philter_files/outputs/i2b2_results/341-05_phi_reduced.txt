Of note , pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK ( **PHIDate** ) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC ( 15 ) and low Hct ( 23 ). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra abdominal abscess that grew out**PHI** **PHI**  . She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc CTX . Outpatient f u abd CT ( **PHIDate** ) showed near complete resolution of the intra abdominal collection . Since that time , however , pt &# 8217 ; s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility . Patient has no complaints . Specifically , she denies fatigue , chest pain , shortness of breath , dizziness , motor weakness and fevers and chills . However , given concern on the part of her sons , pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED . In the MEDIQUIK ED , she was afebrile with HR 70 , BP 150 74 , RR 24 , and **PHI** 100 % RA .

Failure to thrive lethargy The etiology of this pt &# 8217 ; s lethargy is unclear . It is notable , however , that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in **PHI** at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra abdominal bacterial collection . At present , there is no clear source of infection , although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI . Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection , but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile . In addition to **PHI** , UTI and re accumulation of an intra abdominal collection , other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic metabolic causes ( such as uremia ), anemia , or depression . F u blood , urine , and respiratory cultures Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis ( If we were to start abx , would recommend vanc cefepime given micro history ) Culture if spikes Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and **PHI** &# 8217 ; t clinically improve 2 . Anemia &# 8211 ; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past . During last admission , pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy . GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy . It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive . Type and screen Will transfuse 1 unit of **PHI** and monitor for clinical improvement Check post transfusion **PHI** 3 .
