 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**, M.D. Friendship Villa Care Center **PHI** **PHI**, FL **PHI** RE **PHI** MR# **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** Thank you for referring your patient, **PHI** to me for a preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on **PHI**. As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease. She noticed a nodule in her neck in **PHI** or **PHI** of this year and brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in **PHI** of this year. In terms of her cardiac history, she was well until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart failure. At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a dilated left ventricle. In addition, she had an echo in **PHI**71, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. She has never been hospitalized since that time for her congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good result. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or claudication. She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema. In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her recollection. She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty from chest **PHI** MR # **PHI** 2 **PHI** pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops secondary to fatigue. Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had surgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 55. Her social history, she smoked 1 2 packs of cigarettes a day for 40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous drugs or cocaine use. She lives with her husband and briefly worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer. She has no known drug allergies. Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril 50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID. On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170 85 in her left arm and 165 70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7 centimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid bruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with occasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without radiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema. Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80. She has a diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin effects. She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes. In summary, Ms. **PHI** is a 64 year old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%, likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial infarction, although she has never undergone heart catheterization. She is currently undergoing evaluation for a thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. **PHI** MR # **PHI** 3 **PHI** Issue number one, preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with imaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having surgery. Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection fraction. She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection fraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or rhythm. Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons as to how may days she should wait after surgery before restarting that medication. She will otherwise remain on her current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and primary care physician, Dr. **PHI**. If her stress test is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for further evaluation. Thank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen and examined with Dr. **PHI**.
