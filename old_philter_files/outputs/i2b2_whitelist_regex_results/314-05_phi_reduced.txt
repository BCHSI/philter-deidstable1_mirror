MRI brain **PHIDate** small to medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata CTA head and neck **PHIDate** dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation , **PHI** a legitimate interpretation . CNIS **PHIDate** demonstrated **PHI** to **PHI** % stenosis in the proximal left ICA ; velocity of **PHI** in the proximal ICA versus **PHI** in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate ( **PHI** **PHI** %) stenosis of the vessel Echocardiogram ( transthoracic ) **PHIDate** estimated EF of **PHI** to **PHI** %, no regional wall motion abnormalities , mild left atrial enlargement , and no other significant abnormalities . Impression Mrs. **PHI** **PHI** is a **PHI** year old right handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in **PHI** **PHI** . Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , peripheral arterial disease , and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque . She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between **PHIDate** and now . Mrs. **PHI** 's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression . Plan **PHI** . We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis . **PHI** . We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors , with ( **PHI** ) target BP **PHI** **PHI** or less ,( **PHI** ) target LDL < **PHI** ,( **PHI** ) continued glycemic control . Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent . **PHI** . Regarding the spasticity , it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy . Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine , tizanidine , and trihexyphenidyl . I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time . **PHI** . I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. **PHI** 's poor appetite and impaired sleep . After her gabapentin has been appropriately **PHI** , one may consider increasing mirtazapine to **PHI** mg HS . **PHI** . Mrs. **PHI** will be scheduled for follow up in approximately **PHI** months . It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. **PHI** with you . Greater than **PHI** % of this **PHI** minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues . Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions .
