 Record date **PHI** **PHIDate** Dr. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** RE **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** MRN **PHI** DOB **PHIDate** Dear Dr. **PHI** ; We had the pleasure of seeing your patient **PHI** **PHI** today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism . As you know Mr. **PHI** is a pleasant 76 year old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169 , chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck . We . started zoledronic acid IV in **PHIDate** that he tolerated fine . In addition , we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg dL and elevated FSH and LH levels . We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day . He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1 . Osteoporosis . 2 . Hypogonadism . 3 . History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169 , adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy . 4 . Gastroesophageal reflux disease . 5 . Hypertension . 6 . Diabetes type 2 . 7 . Carotid artery disease , left . 8 . Hypercholesterolemia . 9 . Status post AAA repair in 2165 . 10 . Coronary artery disease with status post stent . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days . MEDICATIONS Tricor , metoprolol , Prilosec , Lipitor , aspirin , Plavix , Isordil , Zoloft , vitamin C , Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day , zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day . ALLERGIES Tape . SOCIAL HISTORY He is married and has 3 children . Vital signs Blood pressure 118 48 , pulse 68 , weight 136 pounds . Height 5 feet 4 inches . LABORATORY EVALUATION His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg dL ( normal **PHI** ) on **PHIDate** . His hematocrit is 39 . It was 37 in **PHIDate**.. Platelets are 179,000 . White count 4.8 . In summary , Mr. **PHI** is a 76 year old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer . The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy . I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism . He will continue the current treatment with calcium , vitamin D , testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid . We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now . Please let me know if you have any questions . Yours sincerely , Vincent **PHI** , M.D . cc **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dr. **PHI** Dr. **PHI** DD **PHIDate** TD **PHIDate** 16 37 30**PHI** **PHI**  **PHI** ID **PHI** **PHI** ID **PHI**
