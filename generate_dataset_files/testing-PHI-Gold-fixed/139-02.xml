A/P:

1)CAD- will look for correspondence from Dr. Mora re: his thoughts.  Consider adding low dose beta blocker, since BP is a little.  Needs mor aggressive lowereing of lipid.  At next visit, repeat lipid, and consider lipitor.

2)Back pain- suspect there is some somatization, but patient is far from being able to accept this.  For now, refilled Ibupfofen and follow how often she refills.  Note in record of patient requesting Vicodan, which was given to her before by Dr. Solomon.  Would avoid if possible.

3)Anxiety- Valium 5 mg #15 mg, prn. Offer counseling at next visit if persists.

4)HMC- will ofer colonoscopy at next visit.
