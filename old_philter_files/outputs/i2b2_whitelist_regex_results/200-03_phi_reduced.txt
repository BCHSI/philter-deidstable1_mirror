As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant **PHI** year old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in **PHI** , chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain **PHI** imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus **PHI** in the lumbar spine and minus **PHI** in the femoral neck . We . started zoledronic acid IV in **PHIDate** that he tolerated fine . In addition , we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around **PHI** mg dL and elevated FSH and LH levels . We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day . He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication .

The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy . I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism .
