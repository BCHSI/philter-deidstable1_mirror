Physical Exam



Gen: Well appearing in NAD, WD, WN 

ENT-Sclera were white, fundi disc sharp, conjunctiva clear, tympanic membranes normal, ear canal AS somewhat red. The oropharynx was pink without exudate. The neck was supple with out adenopathy. 

LUNG- clear bilaterally, without rhonci, wheeze or rales, Normal excursion was noted. 

Cor- heart rate was normal, rhythm was regular. No murmurs, gallops or rubs were detected 

Extremities: no clubbing cyanosis or edema. 

Skin- no abnormal lesions noted.







Impression

Ear- benign exam but symptomatic - try cortisporun otic

 

HTN- very high, no sign of end organ injury at this moment- will increase atenolol to 100, and have her rtc for recheck.  It would be helpful to know whether cramps came from hctz or amilodipine.
