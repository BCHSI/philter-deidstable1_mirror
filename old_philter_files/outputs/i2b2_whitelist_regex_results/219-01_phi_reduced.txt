 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** Dame Nursing Home **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Re **PHI** **PHI** MR # **PHI** Dear Matt I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. **PHI** in follow up today . As you know , he recently had a complicated hospital course . He underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD including **PHI** % and **PHI** % stenoses . The first marginal branch had a **PHI** % ostial stenosis . The right coronary artery had **PHI** and **PHI** % stenoses , respectively . The PDA had a **PHI** % narrowing . Given his very significant wish not to have bypass surgery , it was decided to proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as the obtuse marginal . It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel , and not worth going after at this time . The RCA was successfully stented , but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left ventricular branch . By the end of the procedure , flow had been restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch , but Mr. **PHI** rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial infarction . Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular branch , the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated . Mr. **PHI** underwent two exercise tests post procedure . The second exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging . He **PHI** for nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol , and experienced chest pain . He had a maximal blood pressure of **PHI** **PHI** and a heart rate of **PHI** . MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial infarction of the basal **PHIDate** of the inferior wall . There was moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the territory of the RCA . Given these findings , it was highly recommended that Mr. **PHI** undergo bypass surgery . Mr. **PHI** was discharged on aspirin , Ticlid **PHI** mg b.i.d., Atorvastatin **PHI** mg q.h.s., Atenolol **PHI** mg b.i.d., Imdur **PHI** mg q.d . He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin . Of note is that Mr. **PHI** has been under quite a bit of stress recently . His **PHI** year old mother has been at **PHI** recovering **PHI** **PHI** MR # **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** from a hip fracture . He is having difficulty arranging the appropriate insurance to cover her medications . Mr. **PHI** has been **PHI** chest pain since discharge . This occurs with increased activity , and is relief with either rest and or **PHI** nitroglycerin . He has decreased his work level considerably , and is relatively sedentary . On physical exam , he was well appearing and in no distress . He had a blood pressure of **PHI** **PHI** , with a heart rate of **PHI** . His weight was **PHI** pounds . Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion . Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of **PHI** degrees , a nondisplaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or **PHI** . Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without **PHI** . His abdomen is soft , nontender . There is no organomegaly , and no hepatojugular reflux . Extremities are without edema . Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of **PHI** . Intervals are **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , with an axis of **PHI** degrees . There are **PHI** **PHI** waves in III and AVF . I did not have an old electrocardiogram here for comparison . Therefore , Mr. **PHI** returns today still **PHI** angina with mild exertion . He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery . He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work by his physicians , that the Screen Actor 's Guild will make a good case for this . There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to return to work as an actor . Given Mr. **PHI** 's current feeling , I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl **PHI** as soon as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery . It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. **PHI** will be caring for his **PHI** year old mother at home , along with his wife . His mother currently uses a walker , and I have **PHI** Mr. **PHI** that he really can not exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in the house . He understands this , and if his chest pain should become more frequent , intense , or prolonged , he will immediately call me . If Mr. **PHI** is not scheduled for surgery , I will see him in two **PHI** at **PHI** . With **PHI** regards .
