 Record date : **PHI** CARDIOLOGY OAKLAND ASSOCIATES CENTER Reason for visit : s/p Left SFA intervention Interval History : Mr. **PHI** is a **PHI** y.o . male who presented to Dr **PHI** 's office on **PHI** with left foot pain with claudication at approximately **PHI** feet , L & gt ; R , and constant left great toe pain . He has intermittent b/l buttock . Found it difficult to walk from the entrance to the Cath lab today . He describes upon awakening with paresthesias which **PHI** with ambulation . He does not exercise but is active during the day . He also c/o chest discomfort starting last week with palpitations associated with lightheaded . He was resting at the time . He took sl TNG without any improvement . This has **PHI** **PHI** times . He denies sob , n/v , diaphoresis , syncope . CTA RUN on **PHI** showed multilevel disease involving both **PHI** . Right focal area of mild to moderate ISR . Left severe focal stenosis of the SFA proximal to the proximal stent and severe focal **PHI** stenosis within the distal stent . One vessel runoff bilaterally via the peroneal arteries . AVF in the right groin . An Adenosine MIBI was performed on **PHI** . **PHI** with arm exercises for **PHI** ' **PHI** '', reaching **PHI** % of **PHI** . EKG negative for ischemia . Images show small territory of mild septal ischemia , EF **PHI** %. Compared to **PHI** ( done w/ exercise as opposed to adenosine ) the anterior and apical ischemia is no longer evident and the EF is similar **PHI** %. Today he underwent coronary angiography which revealed no change from prior cath . Peripheral angiogram noted aorta and renal arteries were patent . Left and right common and external iliac arteries patent . Stent at the origin of the right ext iliac had a **PHI** % diffuse narrowing . Bilateral internal iliac arteries have moderately severe stenoses in the distal aspect of main branches . The left SFA has two areas of tapered stenosis up to **PHI** % one is proximal and the other is **PHI** ; main popliteal is patent , but focal **PHI** % stenosis present at distal portion prior to trifurcation . Anterior and **PHI** tibial vessels occluded and reconstitute at the ankle by collaterals from the peroneal . The peroneal has calcified **PHI** % diffuse disease in the proximal segment . He therefore underwent PTA of the proximal SFA , PTA and stent to the mid SFA , DCA and PTA of distal popliteal lesion , **PHI** hollow and PTA of proximal peroneal stenosis . He is presently being admitted to Cardiology post intervention . Past medical history : **PHI** . Coronary artery disease . Cath **PHI** showed **PHI** vessel CAD with involvement of distal coronary circulation . All vessels narrow in caliber . LM distal **PHI** %, LAD diffuse proximal plaque and occluded after large diagonal . Faint collaterals supply distal LAD and **PHI** ,. Diagonal patent , Lcx **PHI** % ostial stenosis then **PHI** % irregular stenosis in proximal aspect of AV groove artery after OM1 take off . OM1 patent . Diffuse **PHI** in Lcx and Om . RCA diffuse **PHI** in dominant vessel , narrow up to **PHI** %. EF **PHI** % with mild apical HK . **PHI** . PVD : Stent to right external iliac , **PHI** % narrowing . PTA to SFA , stent to mid SFA , directional arthrectomy and PTA of distal popliteal lesion , **PHI** hollow PTA or proximal peroneal stenosis . Angiogram **PHI** : Peripheral artery disease . **PHI** iliac vessels patent . Left Common iliac **PHI** % plaque distally . Left internal iliac **PHI** , left external iliac patent , left CFA calcified plaque w/ **PHI** % stenosis . Left SFA **PHI** % focal proximal , then **PHI** % mid and **PHI** % stenosis proximal to and into prior . Adductor canal stent , **PHI** % at egress of stent . Left popliteal patent . Peroneal patent but AT and PT occluded . **PHI** **PHI** % tapered . Right common and external **PHI** patent , internal iliac distal stenosis of **PHI** % at complex trifurcation . Right CFA narrowed **PHI** % by plaque . Right SFA and popliteal diffuse plaque deposition , patent . **PHI** balloon **PHI** left distal ( within and above prior stent ) and mid SFA . Stent **PHI** x **PHI** mm Precise in distal SFA overlapping w/ proximal aspect of prior stent , **PHI** x **PHI** mm Exceed in mid SFA in site of **PHI** where there **PHI** a narrowing and dissection . Post dilation of both sites with balloon . PTA and stent **PHI** x **PHI** Cypher in TP trunk . Widely patent to ankle . Patent renal arteries **PHI** . Hypertension . **PHI** . Hyperlipidemia . **PHI** . Type **PHI** diabetes . **PHI** . Left ulnar transposition and left ulnar nerve compression , with prior surgery on **PHI** . **PHI** . Ulcerative colitis diagnosed **PHI** years ago , on medication for a **PHI** time . Episode **PHI** years ago controlled with meds . In the last **PHI** years he has had increased problems and has been hospitalized . He has never had surgery . His last **PHI** was **PHI** months ago . **PHI** . GERD . **PHI** . Gout **PHI** never hospitalized . See Psychiatrist . Past Surgical History : **PHI** . Tonsillectomy **PHI** . Cataract b/l **PHI** . Cholecystectomy Medications ( Confirmed ): aspirin **PHI** **PHI** tab daily clonazepam **PHI** mg BID **PHI** **PHI** mg po tid Effexor XR **PHI** mg qd gabapentin **PHI** mcg bid Indocin 25mg po tid lisinopril **PHI** mg daily metformin hydrochloride **PHI** mcg BID Plavix **PHI** mg daily Protonix 40mg po bid simvastatin **PHI** mg daily terazosin **PHI** mcg BID Toprol XL **PHI** mg po qd Family history : Positive for CAD ( paternal uncle had MI , but not premature onset ) Positive for DM- dad Social history : Retired landscape architect . Smoked **PHI** ppd x over **PHI** years , Now smoking **PHI** cigarettes a day . Quit twice in the past **PHI** years for **PHI** months each time but started again after being **PHI** for UC . ETOH : denies Exercise : nothing formal . Lives in **PHI** , Has three children . Married . Review of systems : Denies headaches , visual changes , no copd , asthma , CV as above . Denies ulcer , has BRBPR b/c of UC on occasion . Denies melena , no kidney , prostate , bladder problems , no stroke , no clotting disorder . Physical examination : -BMI : **PHI** Overweight , moderate risk -Pulse : **PHI** -height : **PHI** in . -weight : **PHI** lbs . -Neck : Carotid upstrokes are normal with no **PHI** appreciated . No JVD -Chest : Clear to auscultation -Cardiac : Bradycardic rate , Normal S1 and S2 , I/VI systolic murmur . -Abdomen : Soft , nontender . -Extremities : Bilateral femoral artery **PHI** , right has systolic and diastolic component and may be c/w AVF , the left fem has a systolic bruit . Left foot with trace DP and 1+ PT , warm to touch , decreased mobility with downward deflection of toes . Right pulse 1+ **PHI** . There is no pedal edema . Mild tenderness to palpation over left DIP joint . -BP : **PHI** EKG : Sinus Bradycardia **PHI** **PHI** , normal EKG Selected recent labs : Metabolic Date BUN CRE **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Impression : **PHI** y.o . male with CAD , PVD who present now with left **PHI** discomfort and chest discomfort . Found to have same coronary anatomy earlier today on angiography . Peripheral angiography noted above stenosis for which he underwent noted interventions . Plan will be for ASA and plavix x **PHI** months or more with plan for discharge in the morning . He should follow up with **PHI** **PHI** PA in **PHI** **PHI** with exercise ABI 's and duplex SFA and proximal **PHI** popliteal . He continues to have tenderness to palpation over left DIP joint which may be consistent with reperfusion issues . It does not appear to be c/w gout , will check uric acid for completeness . Verna P.
