 Record date **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHIDate** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Shelby Dental Care Center **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** Thank you very much for your kind referral of **PHI** **PHI** to the Cardiovascular Division of **PHI** General Hospital . I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction . Please allow me to summarize her history for our records . **PHI** is a very pleasant 51 year old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance . It appears that she had been having a several month history of anginal type symptoms , although a stress test obtained in **PHI** showed no significant ischemia . On **PHIDate** she was in New **PHI** helping a family member with start up of a restaurant , when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness , and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest . She was taken emergently to **PHI** Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting . I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug eluting stents to the right coronary artery . Per her daughter 's report , she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel , which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention . Unfortunately , we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy . Since her myocardial infarction , she actually has felt quite well . She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI . Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well . She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms . Her past medical history is notable for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and glucose intolerance . Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day , Plavix 75 mg a day , metformin 500 mg a day , simvastatin 40 mg a day , nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day , and lisinopril 20 mg a day . She has no known drug allergies . Social History She is married and has three children . She is presently accompanied by her daughter **PHI** who handles the majority of her health care . **PHI** can be reached on a cell phone at **PHI** . She has never used tobacco . Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke . There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family . Review of Systems Cardiac No chest pain , PND , orthopnea , dyspnea , or lower extremity edema . Musculoskeletal No myalgias or **PHI** on lipid lowering therapy . All others are negative . On physical examination , she is an overweight yet well appearing female in no apparent distress . Her blood pressure is 131 86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute . Her weight is 213 pounds . Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes . There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid . The carotid upstrokes are full . Her lungs are clear to auscultation . The heart is normal to palpation , no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced . The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a **PHIDate** systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium . The abdomen is obese , soft , nontender with normal bowel sounds . Her extremities show no edema . Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals . She has Q waves and T wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction . I do not have a recent lipid profile on file . On **PHIDate** , she underwent an echocardiogram . She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg . She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m sec . There are no significant wall motion abnormalities . She has only mild mitral regurgitation . In summary , well we do not have records , it is fairly clear that Mrs. **PHI** has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting . She did receive drug eluting stents . The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction . What is less clear , however , is the status of her other coronaries , there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time . From a clinical standpoint , I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time . She is fairly asymptomatic , and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint . I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point . To this end , I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia . We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study . In terms of her lipids , it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor . The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s . In terms of antithrombotic therapy , she did receive drug eluting stents . Therefore , she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year . After a year , it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures . However , up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself . She is on a very good medical regimen , although I think she would benefit from a beta blocker . The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her , and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended release metoprolol at 25 mg a day . This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control . I will call her daughter **PHI** with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations , and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months . Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care . If you have any further questions regarding her management , do not hesitate to contact me . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , MD eScription document **PHI** IFFocus DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
