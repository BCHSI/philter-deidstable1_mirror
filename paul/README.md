# A couple notes
- Some of the code in this directory was created to work with Philter-Beta, so it might require adjustment to work with this newer version of Philter
- Here's a [link](https://github.com/pauliwog/philter-data) to the data I used
- ```DOCUMENTATION.md``` is, funnily enough, my documentation :grin:
- ```CHANGE-LOG.md``` contains everything I modified/added
- ```details_on_scripts.md``` contains details about my scripts!
- ```blank.json``` is a blank json file just in case I needed it
- ```common_symbols.txt``` contains the symbols I used to find my test set of MIMIC clinical notes
