	OAKLAND ASSOCIATES CENTER

	



	Interval History:

   This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.  The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE &gt; LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.  He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.  The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.  Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.  The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.  Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).  The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.  An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.  The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future.

LLE Angiography:  Mild luminal irregularities within the L CIA, diffuse 40 60% stenosis mid-L IIA stenosis, mild luminal irregularities within the L EIA and L CFA, 40 - 60% ostial L PFA stenosis, 20 - 30% proximal L SFA stenosis, serial 50 - 80% stenoses within the L SFA, mild luminal irregularities within the L popliteal artery, 50 - 70% stenosis of the distal L TPT, total occlusion of the proximal L ATA, mild luminal irregularities within the L peroneal artery, total occlusion of the proximal L PTA.   Percutaneous Intervention:  PTA and stenting to the distal L SFA (using 5.0 mm balloon catheters and a 6.0 x 60 mm Abbott Xpert self-expanding biliary stent), PTA and stenting to the R EIA (using a 5.0 mm balloon catheter and a 6.0 x 24 mm Cordis Palmaz Blue balloon-expandable biliary stent).   Angiographic Results:  Contrast Volume:  200 cc of Isovue iodinated contrast media.   Fluoroscopy Time:  26.3 minutes.   Vascular Closure Device:  None used.   



Lower Extremity Non-Invasive Studies (01/15/2078, at the OAC):

Study included PVRs, segmental pressures, ABIs, and Duplex U/S.  Depressed resting ABI in the RLE (0.70).  Overall normal resting ABI in the LLE (1.00).  Significant decrease in the post-exercise ABI in the RLE (0.24).  Mild-to-moderate decrease in the post-exercise ABI in the LLE (0.50).  Duplex U/S of the previously-stented distal L SFA revealed mild-to-moderately elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal portion of the stent (PSV 178 cm/sec), with normal velocities at the distal end of the stent (PSV 73 cm/sec).  Duplex U/S also revealed revealed significantly elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal L PFA (PSV 306 cm/sec), as well as moderately elevated velocities in the proximal-to-mid L SFA (PSV 191 cm/sec).  Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs.    



	Assessment and plan:

   ASSESSMENT:

63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE &gt; LLE).  In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.  The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.





PLAN:

1.   Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).

2.   Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.

3.   No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.

4.   Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.

5.   Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.  

6.   Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.

7.   Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.

8.   Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.

9.   Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.

10.   Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.

11.   Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.

12.   Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.

13.   Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.
