He was treated with CHOP in **PHI** followed by radiotherapy , completed in **PHI** **PHI** . He was free of disease since then until **PHI** **PHI** . He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic ( HCT **PHI** ). His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as **PHI** a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome . He was considered for a allogenic stem cell transplant . His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since **PHI** **PHI** . It is provoked by eating , drinking and lying down . And only occasionally does he produce any sputum . He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare Fargo for which he received a **PHI** week course of Ceftriaxone , Nafcillin and flagyl ( finished at the end of **PHI** ). In retrospect , he recognizes sinus pressure congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis . In **PHI** **PHI** he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro . On pre transplant work up , CXR revealed increase conspicuity of ill defined LL zone opacity . CT chest reviewed today revealed **PHI** pneumonia with associated radiation related changes . Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at **PHI** and given abx and **PHI** . He recalls **PHI** as the fevers broke . He does admit to maybe a **PHI** lb weight loss in the past **PHI** months . He denies SOB ( unless he s severely anemic ), orthopnea , sore throat , dysphagia , odynophagia , CP , palpitations , angina like symptoms , acid reflux , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , constipation , BRBPR , dysuria , frequency , nocturia , joint or muscle pain . He does have mild peripheral neuropathy in his feet bilaterally .

He recently gave his indoor cat away as he **PHI** that she had something to do with his cough MDS . He does not recall tick bites and has infrequently visited **PHI** and **PHI** .

Cardiomediastinal **PHI** is stable . Nodular opacity in the left perihilar region appears less apparent . No new consolidations are seen . There is a new left sided **PHI** catheter with its tip in the SVC . No pneumothorax is seen . Impression **PHI** yo M with h o IDDM , large cell lymphoma in **PHI** , and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology . The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non infectious diagnoses . Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease , such as COP . However , we also think that several infectious **PHI** should be considered . Endemic mycoses ( histo , **PHI** and crypto ), cryptococcal pneumonia , nocardiasis , aspergillus , mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient . While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease , the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers , progressive weight loss and systemic illness **PHI** against this diagnosis . I ( **PHI** ) have **PHI** and examined Mr. **PHI** , and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note . My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process , such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP COP . An occult infection is quite possible , such as pulmonary MAC or a mold ( the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious ). Clinically he is unchanged over many months , so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated . We recommend the following work up **PHI** sputum for gram stain and culture Induced sputum for PCP Modified AFB smear ( looking for Nocardia ) Fungal stain and culture Urine histo antigen Serum cryptococcal antigen Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D glucan Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel ( RSV , Adenovirus , Influenza A and B , **PHI** **PHI** and B ) and viral culture If the above work up is unrevealing , please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy sooner rather than later . It is reasonable to start is levaquin **PHI** mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens ( this medication is scheduled to begin in two days , per protocol ). Our recommendations were **PHI** to Dr. **PHI** and Dr. Robin **PHI** of the patient s primary team . Thank you for this consult .
