 Record date : **PHI** CARDIOLOGY **PHI** MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Reason for visit : Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than **PHI** yards and also balance disorder . Interval History : Mr. **PHI** **PHI** is a **PHI** gentleman who comes into **PHI** Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance . His referring physician is Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** out of **PHI** Clinic . Mr. **PHI** also heard about the **PHI** VC through TV advertisements . He is **PHI** years old , has history of diabetes starting in **PHI** , known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort , for which he has previously seen Dr. **PHI** at **PHI** Clinic , and also has been **PHI** and treated at the **PHI** District Hospital . Specifically , he describes having been **PHI** by Dr. **PHI** and others some three or four years ago , and undergoing at least two procedures , all related to his legs cramping up . He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery , so far as I can tell . The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center ( Big Rapids , AC ) and also he had evaluation at the **PHI** District Hospital , and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there . The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times , but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all . Currently , he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast , and this stops him at about **PHI** yards . The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive **PHI** symptoms , walking in a shuffle , tipping forward , and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely . His legs are rubbery , and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it **PHI** . It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything . At the same time , his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication , and he has known peripheral artery disease . Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up . The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms , especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature . Again , there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication , as to which is truly causing his disability . Past medical history : Diabetes , onset in **PHI** . **PHI** movement disorder , followed by Dr. **PHI** and **PHI** , and for which he was placed on Sinemet , **PHI** it was due to Parkinson 's . The patient has not improved despite trying the medications . MRI at AC starting in **PHI** has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy , unchanged . Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report . Neuropathy , documented by EMG in **PHI** with no spinal stenosis by MRI . Cervical spondylosis . Tracheal tumor resection in **PHI** performed via a suprasternal incision . Hypertension . Mild renal artery stenosis documented by arteriography in **PHI** during one of his peripheral angiograms . Current Medications : lisinopril **PHI** mg QD glyburide **PHI** mg QD cilostazol **PHI** mg BID terazosin **PHI** mg QD Sinemet **PHI** mg **PHI** tabs TID aspirin **PHI** mg QD pyridoxine **PHI** mg QD atenolol **PHI** mg QD folic acid **PHI** mg QD gabapentin **PHI** mg BID metformin hydrochloride **PHI** mg TID ranitidine HCl **PHI** mg QHS Zocor **PHI** mg QHS Plavix ; Dir : Stopped because of ecchymosis and epistaxis -stop Allergies : No known allergies Family history : Noncontributory . No coronary artery disease or MI . Social history : He is **PHI** Motor Vehicle Body Repairer . He used to work at GM . He lives with his wife , who comes in today with him . He has three children . Nondrinker . He smoked until **PHI** years ago . Review of systems : Detailed review of systems was carried out . It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him . He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD . He has nocturia . He wears dentures . No significant weight loss or anorexia . No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy . He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia . Otherwise , review of systems is negative in detail . Physical examination : -Pulse : **PHI** and regular . Afebrile -BP : **PHI** , obtained by myself . Equal bilaterally -General : Well-developed male in no distress , appears his stated age . Slightly **PHI** over , and has a **PHI** affect and appearance -Skin : Without rashes -Heent : Normal facies , or slightly masked , with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils -Neck : Carotid upstrokes are normal , no **PHI** . No JVD -Chest : Clear -Cardiac : **PHI** normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4 , and no murmurs -Abdomen : Moderately obese , protuberant , soft , and nontender . Good bowel sounds , no organomegaly , no enlargement of the aorta . May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation -Extremities : Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally , with soft **PHI** on both sides . Below this , no cyanosis or edema ( perhaps trace to 1+ edema ), and posterior tibial pulses are **PHI** to 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable . Good capillary refill -Neuro : Gait is disturbed , with slight shuffling and slightly **PHI** . His strength is normal , and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a **PHI** distribution . He does not have any **PHI** to my examination . Otherwise , no focal deficits Procedures : Free text procedures Exercise **PHI** ABI is normal on the right and left at **PHI** . **PHI** and **PHI** , respectively . The toe brachial index drops to **PHI** on the right side and **PHI** at **PHI** minute after exercise . I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual **PHI** indices were not measured following exercise . EKG : demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of **PHI** . There is normal axis and intervals , with no evidence of prior infraction , and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay . Other Data : DOB : **PHI** . Assessment and plan : Lower extremity arterial disease ( PAD ) -the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides . Currently , complains of symptoms that sound like claudication , predominantly involving the calves on both sides , right slightly ahead of the left , and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA . Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest , I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA , for example . On the other hand , he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated . His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than **PHI** yards and stops him at that point , and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder , possible Parkinson 's disease . I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined , and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease , and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment . **PHI** . As far his peripheral artery disease , it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH , to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed . Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention , it is likely he will need another angiographic study ( or **PHI** ) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease . **PHI** . Neurologic **PHI** will refer to a neurologist . PLAN : **PHI** . Formal exercise ABIs . **PHI** . Obtain angiographic studies from AC . **PHI** . Followup visit in one month . **PHI** .
