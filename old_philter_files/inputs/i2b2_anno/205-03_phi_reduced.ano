 Record date **PHI** OFFICE NOTE FRANKFORT INTERNAL MEDICINE **PHI** 2nd Floor **PHI**, SD **PHI** **PHI** MRN **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** returns today for follow up after her admission for acute shortness of breath and congestive heart failure. I had added Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well. However, her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant increase in her BUN and creatinine. Her BUN is in the 80's, and her creatinine is about 3.4. She states her breathing has been excellent, however. She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on exertion. She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer having any kind of dry cough. Medications Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o. q.day, Paxil 20 p.o. q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o. q.day, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day, Atenolol 50 p.o. q.day, Lasix 120 p.o. b.i.d., Zaroxolyn 2.5 p.o. q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day. Allergies Cephalexin causes questionable rash. Physical Examination Today she is a pleasant black female in no acute distress. Her weight is 330 pounds. This is down over 20 pounds over the past month. Her blood pressure is 122 80. Her pulse is 80. Her lungs are clear. Her heart reveals distant heart sounds but regular in rhythm and rate. Her extremities are notable for the absence of lower extremity edema. Her abdomen is also noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the past. Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm. There is beefy red granulation tissue surrounding this. Diagnosis 1. Congestive heart failure. 2. Coronary artery disease, status post CABG. 3. Morbid obesity. 4. Adult onset diabetes mellitus. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency. 6. Foot ulcer. 7. Depression. 8. Health maintenance. **PHI** MRN **PHI** **PHI** Page Two Plan 1. Congestive heart failure. She is doing much better on higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds since her last visit here about a month ago. At this point in time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low fat and low sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights, and she will follow up with me in the office in two weeks and per telephone conversation in four days. Should she have an increase in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me. 2. Coronary artery disease, status post CABG. Stable without any symptoms of exertional chest pain. Continue current medication. 3. Morbid obesity. She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program. I strongly wanted her to go on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings. She is planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care. I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight. 4. Adult onset diabetes mellitus. Stable. Continue current regimen. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency. The plan as above is to stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days. 6. Diabetic foot ulcer. I also gave her a duoderm dressing to try, and she is going to continue to follow up with her podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about appropriate treatment. **PHI**, M.D. DD **PHI** DT **PHI** DV **PHI** **PHI** ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
