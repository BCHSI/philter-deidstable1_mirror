 Record date **PHI** Patient **PHI** [ **PHI**(BHC) ] FDate of Visit **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. **PHI** at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow up of her exertional dyspnea. As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture. Her other respirtory related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies. She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema. Her work up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively. She has had a negative cardiac stress test. PMH as above Meds synthroid, labetalol, norvasc, glipizide, coumadin, erythropoetin, pravastatin, ultram, albuterol, pentasa Allergies PCN, cephalosporins, vancomysin, shellfish SH no tobacco ever. She is a professional tool maker. She has a dog FH asthma, CAD, DM, HTN ROS as per HPI, otherwise negative in detail EXAM HR 88, BP 135 60, 98% RA, Wt 146lb OP clear Lungs CTAB Heart RRR Abdomen soft NTND 1+ LE edema, no clubbing **PHI** Date **PHI** Broadwater Health Center Pulmonary Function Laboratory **PHI** **PHI**, Arkansas **PHI** Phone **PHI** Fax **PHI** Medical Director **PHI**, M.D. Name **PHI** MRN **PHI** Date of Birth **PHI** Date of Test **PHI** Gender Female Location Chest Lab Height 65 in Referring Physician **PHI** Weight 145 lb Attending Physician **PHI** Race Black Technician **PHI** Resp.Diagnosis 786.09 Study Status Final SPIROMETRY (BTPS) Predicted Pre BD Post BD Percent Range Change Mean 95% CI Actual %Pred Actual %PredFVC (Lts) 2.33 1.65 1.38 59 1.38 59 0FEV1 (Lts) 1.67 1.11 1.02 61 1.08 65 6FEV6 (Lts) 1.97 1.25 1.38 70 1.38 70 0FEV1 FVC (%) 73 64 74 101 78 107 5FEV1 FEV6 (%) 78 69 74 95 78 100 5FEF25 75 (L s) 1.23 0.09 0.71 58 0.94 76 32PEFR (L s) 3.88 1.81 4.95 128 4.62 119 7FET (Secs) 6.67 7.64 15 PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1 FVC is normal. There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator. The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit. Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated. Since **PHI**, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed. IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS DOE is likely multifactorial. It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed. In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab. Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture. There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either. I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her. I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma. We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.
