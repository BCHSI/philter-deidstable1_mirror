Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer S P debridement and later TMA . He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow up . At baseline , patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy , has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25 % compliance . At the time of his last admission , he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement . The patient 's wound has currently not been closed . He has a vac dressing in place . He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology . Current hospital course has been complicated by increased agitation and last evening , self limited substernal chest pain and dyspnea . This resolved spontaneously .

Assessment Plan In summary,62 y o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes . Presenting with necrotic foot infection , polymicrobial . S P Rt TMA . Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start . By issue 1 ) CAD The patient does have CAD , MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention , given patient noncompliance . The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management . If BP allows , could increase toprol XL , although I suspect that this will not be an option . In addition , would aim to keep even at dialysis . Certainly , cycle **PHI** and troponin and follow sx . I will defer to Dr. **PHI** , but I do n't see clear benefit for cardiac cath , especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture . If he were to become more compliant , this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident , perhaps this will be a future consideration . 2 ) Delirium He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start . He is off of this baseline , likely reflecting sundowning , medications and underlying metabolic processes . Please d c medications that might be contributing to sx . Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior . Might hold ranitidine as well . Haldol is d cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc . Currently on olanzapine . Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d c this med as well is still prolonged . Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures . 3 ) Infection Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient 's wound . Levofloxacin has been d cd 2nd to concerns for altered mental status . All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative . Would seek ID input to the end . Wound care per vascular with plans for D C when stable and return for closure in the future . 4 ) ESRD Patient HAD dialysis today . **PHI** per nephrology 3 ) DM **PHI** was at target . Please cover as needed with RISS for now . 5 ) Competency certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time . Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP . Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible . Thanks , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** # **PHI** **PHI** to cover for Thursday and Friday
