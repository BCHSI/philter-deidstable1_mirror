He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted , particularly in the hot weather , a sense of dyspnea after walking about **PHI** feet to his mailbox , or across a large parking lot , such as Grand Union . At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that **PHI** for a minute or two , and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed . He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year . He has not had any **PHI** related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions . MEDICATIONS **PHI** . Aspirin **PHI** mg daily . **PHI** . Clopidogrel **PHI** mg daily . **PHI** . Atorvastatin **PHI** mg daily . **PHI** . Lopid **PHI** mg b.i.d . **PHI** . Toprol XL **PHI** mg daily . **PHI** . Xanax , Benadryl at bedtime , multivitamin . INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS **PHI** . Higher dose beta blocker orthostasis . **PHI** . Lisinopril questionable contribution to orthostasis . On examination , he is comfortable at rest . The blood pressure is **PHI** **PHI** checked twice , supine , standing it is **PHI** **PHI** , heart rate **PHI** and regular , weight **PHI** pounds , oxygen saturation **PHI** %. The jugular venous pressure is **PHI** . The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed . The chest is clear . Cardiac exam shows a grade II VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex . The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly , pulsatile masses or **PHI** . There is no peripheral pitting edema . The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST T wave abnormalities compared to **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . In summary , Mr. **PHI** has **PHI** . History of CAD , status placement of a drug eluting stent in the LAD , **PHIDate** , without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction . Repeat cardiac catheterization , **PHIDate** , because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis . **PHI** . Hypertension , not controlled . His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea . We spoke about the options . As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril , will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure . He will add hydrochlorothiazide **PHI** mg daily plus amlodipine **PHI** mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week . To investigate potential **PHI** to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia , blood studies today will include electrolytes , plasma metanephrine level and TSH . A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is **PHI** with the sense of `` fluttering '' which occurs at least nightly . Once his blood pressure is controlled , an exercise test will follow . [ Addendum Holter shows single **PHI** bigeminy at time of his symptoms . Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines . He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the **PHI** 's on **PHI** **PHI** , no further palpitations . He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT ] **PHI** . Dyslipidemia , on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy . When it is time to renew his Lopid , it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy . A serum CK will be included in today 's blood studies . **PHI** . Mild mitral regurgitation . It was a pleasure to see Mr. **PHI** today and I will report back to you following his Holter .
