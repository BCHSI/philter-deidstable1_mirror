I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues . She comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face . Actually , upon exam , she clearly simply has left TMJ . She has been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had planned . However , she has other medical problems which I will deal with until she sees you . At her last visit , there was a question of PMR and she had `` **PHI** shots '' of steroids but I have not given her steroids and she has done reasonably well . However , she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes , hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include metformin , verapamil **PHI** b.i.d., Avapro **PHI** q.d., Pravachol **PHI** q.d., Bumex , Bentyl , Prilosec and Allegra . Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which **PHI** her pain . She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . HEENT was otherwise unremarkable . I obtained blood studies which revealed a blood sugar of **PHI** , abnormal LFTs with an AST of **PHI** and ALT of **PHI** , normal ferritin B12 and folic acid , TSH of **PHI** with thyroid antibodies pending , urine **PHI** of **PHI** and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of **PHI** . A1c pending . A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did not reveal proteinuria or sediment . HBsAG and HCV are pending as well . I will be in touch with her regarding these results . I was **PHI** if you could see her sooner than September because of these abnormalities **PHI** . Thanks for letting me participate in her care .
