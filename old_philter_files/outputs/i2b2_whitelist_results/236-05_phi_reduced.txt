Internal Medicine Associates **PHI** Memorial Hospital **PHI** **PHI** Street Minerva , TN **PHI** Dear **PHI** : Mr. **PHI** returns for followup . Since last seen , she apparently was recently seen in the **PHI** clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression . She **PHI** if she was having a flare of her porphyria . Apparently , her examination at that time was relatively benign , and no specific new findings were noted . After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit , she felt modestly improved , and over the past few **PHI** feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline . Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine **PHI** , glucose elevated at **PHI** , hematocrit of **PHI** , with a white count **PHI** . As no specific pathology was noted , she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen . Currently , she continues on Lantus insulin **PHI** units subcutaneous . q.p.m., Celexa **PHI** mg p.o . q.d., **PHI** aspirin **PHI** mg p.o . q.d., Flonase **PHI** puffs p.o . q.d., isosorbide mononitrate **PHI** mg p.o . q.d., Neurontin **PHI** mg p.o . t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n . which she has not had to take , lisinopril **PHI** mg p.o . q.d., furosemide **PHI** mg p.o . q.d., and p.r.n . Motrin . Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress . Blood pressure right arm sitting **PHI** , heart rate **PHI** and regular , respirations **PHI** and unlabored , and weight is pending . The neck is supple . JVP is flat . Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs . Chest is clear . Cardiac exam shows normal S1 , physiologically split S2 with **PHI** systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base , and a **PHI** holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla . No significant diastolic murmur or rub . The abdomen is benign . Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema . Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable . Electrocardiogram is pending . Impression : Ms. **PHI** remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective . However , as you know , her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function . She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease . Nonetheless , I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help **PHI** the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation , which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen . Beyond this , her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint . I have not further altered her medical regimen . Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care . Sincerely yours , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
