Neurological : AJ absent . **PHI** and Plan : **PHI** year old man with aortic stenosis , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure and longstanding type **PHI** diabetes . His average control has apparently been good on the combination of chlorpropamide and metformin , although we can not be sure of that in view of his anemia and the fact that he was not testing his glucose at home . Metformin is relatively contraindicated since his GRF is certainly diminished with creatinine **PHI** at age **PHI** . Lantus does not appear to be the right insulin for him . Would D/C it in favor of NPH **PHI** U in AM ( watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect ). Check QID BS but cover with scale only before breakfast and supper . I have not addressed the issue of **PHI** term insulin use with him , although it would be my first choice . Even at his age , I suspect that he would have no difficulty **PHI** it given his relatively youthful mind . Other alternatives would be **PHI** ( if forced to use one , would choose glimepiride ) and **PHI** , for example repaglinide . Thanks . Will follow . **PHI** M. **PHI** , M.D., Ph.D .
