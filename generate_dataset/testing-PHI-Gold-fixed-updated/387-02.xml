Mr Gillespie is a 53 yo man with a history of NIDDM and hypertension who presented to House Of Calvary Hospital today with a chief complaint of cough for the last 5 days.  He was in his usual state of health prior to that.  Cough has been dry; also notes shortness of breath with exertion and diaphoresis.  He notes intermittent palpitations and mild lightheadedness during the last few days.  He has had pneumonia several times in the past.  He denies fever, chills, SOB at rest, orthopnea, PND, chest pain, wheezing, hemoptysis, and sick contacts.   He reports compliance with his medications and no recent change in diet.  At Calvary, CXR was interpreted as bilateral pneumonia L&amp;gt;R.  EKG revealed atrial fibrillation, of which he had no known history.  He was referred to the GRH ED for further evaluation.



In the ED he was afebrile, HR 130s-140s (atrial fibrillation)  SBP 140s  O2 sat 99-100%.  On exam he had fine bibasilar crackles.
