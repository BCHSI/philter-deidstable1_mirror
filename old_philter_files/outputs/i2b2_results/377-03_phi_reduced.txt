Immediately following her 2nd R fem pop BPG in **PHIDate** , she felt well and without significant LE pain . Over the past month , however , the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg , which wakes her up from sleep almost every night . She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest . She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot , along with numbness and paresthesias , which have been progressive over the same time period . She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described . Specifically , she denies chest pain , shortness of breath , dizziness , headache , and fevers chills . She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful , although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg . She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly , but has not taken coumadin for 2 days ( last dose **PHIDate** ). She last underwent arterial LENIs on **PHIDate** , which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem pop BPG ( see below for official report ). She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg .
