Recommendations : **PHI** . Neuro : Would get a brain **PHI** to further evaluate . After the MRI is done , would get a neurology consult in the morning . Continue ASA , BP control in the meantime . Patient may need a repeat LP depending on neuro consult **PHI** . **PHI** . Pulm : CF appears stable . Would continue his outpatient Advair , albuterol , **PHI** . **PHI** .

Critical care Fellow Pager : **PHI** Lung Transplant Attending Note : I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. **PHI** and I agree with her evaluation and plan as **PHI** above . Mr. **PHI** is a **PHI** yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease , who presented to an OSH on **PHI** with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias , followed by a loss of left visual field , diplopia , and left sided weakness . The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness . The patient was **PHI** at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein . Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms , as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam . Exam also notable for **PHI** , otherwise neurologic exam non-focal . Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles . DDX for above includes ischemic process , though symptoms appear to be multi-focal , vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process . Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms , or meningeal process . We plan to obtain CNS MRI , neuro consult . Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up . Continue maintenance medications for CF . **PHI** **PHI** F. **PHI** , MD
