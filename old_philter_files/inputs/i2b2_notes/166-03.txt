Patient: Meyer, Oscar
MRN: 2771447
Admission Date:  12/2/2095
JAR: Dr. Patricia Whittaker
Attending: Dr. Jolley
Source: Patient, records
                                                                              
ID/CC: 64yoM with type II DM and HL p/w exertional SSCP, found to have lateral precordial/apical STDs


HPI:
Oscar Meyer is a 64yoM with type II DM and HL who has been having exertional, non-radiating, SSCP with activities such as shoveling snow and taking out the trash over the past several months, increasing in frequency.  He endorses 6 episodes over the last week, the most recent yesterday morning when he was shoveling.  The pain always resolves after 4-5 min of rest and deep breathing.  He denies n/v, palps, LH, and SOB but does have diaphoresis at times.  He presented to the SCH ED for evaluation today.


OSH course: The patient was hypertensive (max BP 200/89); he received Lopressor 5 mg IV x 2, resulting in BP 170/90; an additional 5-mg dose resulted in BP 160/87 (later, 146/79 just prior to transfer).  EKG showed small 0.5-1 mm STDs in V4-6.  Initial TnI was 1.00 (CK/MB wnl).  He received ASA 325, Nitropaste 1/2&#8221; (despite the fact that he takes Viagra at home), A heparin gtt was started (with bolus), and the patient was transferred to WPH in anticipation of cardiac cath.

EKG (floor arrival): NSR at 69 bpm.  QT~440 ms; QTc~470 ms.  0.5-1 mm STDs in V4-6 and TWF in aVF.


CXR (SCH): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
     
Assessment:
64yoM with multiple cardiac risk factors p/w NSTEMI.

Ischemia: Plan for cath in a.m.  ASA, Lipitor, Lopressor, captopril, heparin gtt; tolerate up ACEI/B-blocker as tolerated.  Note that patient takes Viagra and therefore should ideally not have nitrates for CP, although he did tolerate Nitropaste at SCH; note that last dose of Viagra was Thursday, 11/29.  Serial EKGs and telemetry.  Will defer initiation of Integrilin until cath lab, as there is no clear benefit to starting now.  Need to check fasting lipids. 
Prolonged QTc: Etiology unclear, and no prior EKGs for comparison.  Will replete lytes for goal Mg=2, K=4. 
Pump: No ssx of CHF.  Will obtain post-cath TTE to assess for WMAs. 
DM: Holding orals while in house.  IVF with D5 while npo; cover FSBGs with RISS.  Will give Mucomyst and IVF for nephroprotection with cath. 
Ppx: Heparin.
