 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , MD Nevada Hospital Internal Medicine 01 **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** City , NH **PHI** Dear **PHI** **PHI** had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. **PHI** **PHI** in clinic today . As you know , he is a 78 year old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at **PHIDate** in **PHI** with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction . I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery . I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings . The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to **PHI** . At that time in **PHI** he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged . He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in **PHI** . He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99 %), first OM ( 90 %) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80 % proximal and then 90 % distal ). An LV gram showed an EF of 55 % with just mild mitral regurgitation . An echo performed here at the **PHI** was consistent . Since he has returned to America several weeks ago , he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort , which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic . Since then , he has had no further episodes . ROS Denies PND , orthopnea , symptoms of TIA , stroke , lightheaded , or syncope . He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion . PMH Diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , stroke ( numbness in his right hand and leg , but that had predominantly resolved ). Meds aspirin 81 mg a day , clopidogrel 75 mg a day , bisoprolol 5 mg once a day , ranitidine 300 mg a day , atorvastatin 40 mg a day , metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening . This is an Equadorian formulation . SHx He does not drink , nor smoke . FHx Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60 . Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate . On exam , he looks well . His heart rate is in the 64 . His blood pressure was 115 70 . His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits . His jugular venous pressures were not elevated . His chest was clear to auscultation . His cardiac exam revealed a **PHIDate** holosystolic murmur at the apex . His abdomen was soft . Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses . Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit . In summary , Mr. **PHI** is a very nice Spanish speaking 78 year old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3 vessel disease . He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory . I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding . With warm regards , Sincerely yours ,
