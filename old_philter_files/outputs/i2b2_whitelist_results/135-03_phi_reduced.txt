Syncope : hx worrisome for cardiac etiology given suddenness of the episode w/o much warning . Likely **PHI** could be some decreased pre-load in setting of recent increased diuresis , perhaps decreased po intake in a woman dependent on preload **PHI** her valvular disease . In **PHI** , pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate **PHI** her pacer . Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well . -- will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease , LV function , could consider stress test -- will consult EP to assess pacer function -- pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight -- will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent -- will re-check carotid studies -- will re-start ASA ( it was recently stopped ) given carotid and vascular disease **PHI** . CHF : pt carries diagnosis of CHF and CXR c/w some pulmonary congestion . On exam , pt with crackles bilaterally also c/w pulm edema . -- will cont outpt lasix but need to be very careful given pt 's **PHI** volume status **PHI** . COPD : cont outpt regimen **PHI** .
