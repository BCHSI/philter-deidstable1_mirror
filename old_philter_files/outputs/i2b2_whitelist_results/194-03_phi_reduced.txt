Certainly in someone with known CAD , cardiogenic **PHI** is most concerning , namely , MI , with atypical features . However , his EKG is unchanged , his troponins are negative , and he never had chest pain . Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia , as his heart rate has been in the **PHI** and **PHI** . However , I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis , was dehydrated , and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion . It is worth checking **PHI** given his rigorous blood pressure regimen . There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic **PHI** given his story . Syncope : Stable , no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight Has completed MI r/o Continue ASA , beta blocker ,( w/ hold parameters ), statin , ACE Has close follow up w/ Dr. **PHI** ( next week ), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house CAD : As above , will d/c on **PHI** PO Toprol BID per Dr. **PHI** recommendations Diabetes : Diet controlled at home RISS while in house with BID **PHI** to assess glucose control Elevated WBC : Likely **PHI** gastroenteritis .
