Of note, he had his usual chest pain, relieved with one SL TNG several times a week. He did take one SL TNG shortly before his fall. 



In ER, he was diagnosed with UTI and admitted for treatment and gait evaluation.

Head CT with right caudate nucleus lacune 



MRI/MRA: small chronic infarct in the right caudate with porencephalic changes. Apparent moderate stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery 



Chest CT: No acute displaced fracture or dislocation. Multiple large mediastinal lymph nodes, largest in right paratracheal region. Findings may be reactive. Follow up is recommended if clinically indicated. Pleural calcifications with associated nodules, also seen on prior examination. Findings likely represent asbestos exposure. 



Echo: moderate MR, EF 46%, inferoapical HK/AK, Elevated RVSP 88 



A/P: 

88 year old man s/p mechanical fall, perhaps some orthostasis due to NTG or postprandial state. He looks baseline. Testing has revealed a number of abnormalities but do not think this is directly related to presentation. 



1. s/p fall: evaluate with PT, check orthostatics after meal. Back pain likely muscular- no fracture- treat with low dose oxycodone 

2. UTI: on levofloxacin, await culture 

3. CAD/CHF: appears euvolemic, ruled out for MI. Resume outpatient lasix and ACEI if BP allows. Echo shows Inferoapical HK, and high RV pressures- ? volume overload, ? pulmonary disease. Will ask Dr. Youmans to advise on management. 

4. Chronic lacunar stroke: already on ASA/statin. 

5. Mediastinal adenopathy: no work up in hospital. 

6. DM: May continue oral agents, check FS glucose. 



He would like to go home ASAP- he is not interested in many tests, and goal will be to d/c home with services.
