 Record date **PHI** PROMPTCARE INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** HPI This is a regularly scheduled visit for this **PHI** a 44 year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity. She was last here in **PHI** with no complaints, but did have an elevated creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further evaluation. The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as planned. She states that she has been "too busy." Her only complaint today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is relieved to some extent by acetaminophen. **PHI** continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day. A noted in her ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, **PHI** believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than on an almost p.r.n. basis. Review of systems is essentially normal. Specifically, she denies any headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath. She also denies any symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract. She has no history of dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria. Physical Examination She is robust appearing. Vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 140 100. HEENT exam is unremarkable. Lungs are clear. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1, S2. No S3 is appreciated. There are no murmurs or rubs. Abdomen is slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds. No masses are appreciated. Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion. Indeed, exam of her legs is entirely unremarkable. Laboratory Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine sediment and a urine creatinine. Assessment and Plan 1. Hypertension **PHI** has had persistently elevated blood pressure on her Procardia. I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day. I will see her in a few days in order to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug and also to check her blood pressure once again. 2. Right leg pain This would appear to be chronic and may well be related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.) I have asked her to continue taking Tylenol and we will re evaluate her need for more powerful agents, such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.

In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. **PHI**. She is to see him on the **PHI** of this month at 1 00 p.m. and I have also left a message on his E mail mentioning **PHI** to him. Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney function. 4. Health Maintenance The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear today, but again was "too busy to stay that long." She is to see me again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time. Her **PHI** mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and will not be repeated until next year. **PHI**, M.D. TD **PHI** **PHI** DD **PHI** DT **PHI** DV **PHI** ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********
