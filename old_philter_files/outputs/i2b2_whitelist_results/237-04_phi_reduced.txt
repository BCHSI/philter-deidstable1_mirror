He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December **PHI** . He underwent **PHI** of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common **PHI** arteries . As you know , he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left . He previously has undergone CABG in **PHI** with repeat angio in **PHI** showing patent IMA to LAD graft , patent **PHI** graft , and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA . He underwent **PHI** of his native RCA with a BMS at that time . Additionally , he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis . He returns today for review . He remains in reasonable health . He is still **PHI** to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery . He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit , on each side .

Impression : Mr **PHI** is a **PHI** year old gentleman with extensive PAD **PHI** now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication . He is now also **PHI** years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia . Finally , he **PHI** repeat duplex of his carotids . Assessment and plan : **PHI** . CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test . **PHI** . PAD- worsening claudication , will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene . **PHI** . Carotid disease ; currently asymptomatic , will repeat CANIs .
