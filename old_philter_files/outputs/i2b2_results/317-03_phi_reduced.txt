 Record date **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHIDate** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** Your patient , **PHI** **PHI** , was in the Surgery Clinic today . As you know , she is a 52 year old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease . She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . She has done well since the procedure . She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain . She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT , which it did . She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot . On exam , she is a well appearing female in no acute distress . She is alert and oriented x3 . She appears grossly neurologically intact . Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg . Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe . This does not appear infected and I can not probe to bone . It remains superficial . She has no other ischemic skin changes noted . I have discussed with **PHI** that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes . She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery . She is enquiring about starting Neurontin . I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy . She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation . She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen . If I can be of further assistance in her care , do not hesitate to contact me . Sincerely , **PHI** Shea , MD Dictated by **PHI** **PHI** , PA C
