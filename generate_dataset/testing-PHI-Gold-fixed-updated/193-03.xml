The patient, Foust, was seen in the Emergency Department on

01/31/2095.  The patient was seen by Dr. Ferrer.  I have

discussed the management with him.  I have also seen the patient

personally and reviewed the ED record.  This is an addendum to

the record.

this morning she went to the bathroom, was sitting on the

commode, felt chest tightness, and then had a syncopal episode. 

She has never had this chest tightness before.  She is unsure

whether she hit her head.  No shortness of breath and no

exertional symptoms in the past.
