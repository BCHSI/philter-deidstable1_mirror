 Record date **PHI** **PHI** yo male from Kazakhstan here for f u of GI mucor . Briefly , he was admitted **PHIDate** with DKA and MSSA bacteremia . He was found to have perirectal abscess s p CT guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s p removal and drainage in OR on **PHIDate** and by IR **PHIDate** , both sites positive for MSSA . Hospital course c b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s p ex lap **PHIDate** , gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection , splenectomy and primary anastamosis , with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins . He also had VRE klebsiella LUQ abscess s p IR drainage . He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome , but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin . So he was switched to vanco ambisome linezolid meropenem amikacin for LUQ abscess . After **PHI** **PHI** of high dose ambisome , he was taken back to OR on **PHIDate** for re exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal jejunostomy site that surgeons `` scooped out '' as much as they could , but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions . Given the inability to completely en bloc resect Mr. **PHI** 's GI mucor despite a **PHI** trial of Ambisome , he was started on an investigational drug , posaconazole , provided by **PHI** on a compassionate use basis . This has had **PHI** % success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials . He was started on this drug on **PHIDate** and has tolerated it well despite some nausea , diarrhea . He has been at EDUCARE FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip . He walks with a walker . He had repeat CT abd **PHI** **PHIDate** which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection . He had abd drains removed **PHI** **PHI** ago but continues to have L hip drain , without much output . He was started on TPN **PHI** week ago due to **PHI** , despite po intake . He has been trying to eat , but reports some nausea and diarrhea , especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole . He reports good glycemic control .

Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well , but does have significant nausea , somewhat controlled with zofran . Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect , or due to dumping syndrome . Plan **PHI** ) continue posaconazole **PHI** ) need to have ortho f u to evaluate L hip collection **PHI** ) RTC in **PHI** month **PHIDate** at **PHI** to f u for posaconazole . Will need EKG again at EDUCARE FARGO before transfer here . Mr. **PHI** seen and examined with Dr. **PHI** . He is very slowly improving in terms of strength , no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN . Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea , although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects . On balance , if his labs are ok , I 'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings . ECG without QTc prolongation . Abdomen is bening . Left hip still sore , but more and more stable . **PHI** **PHI** , MD
