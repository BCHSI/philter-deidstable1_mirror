 Record date **PHI** OFFICE NOTE **PHI** MRN # **PHI** **PHI** Ms. **PHI** returns today for a follow up status post her coronary artery bypass surgery on **PHI**. Since the surgery she has done quite well. She was in Sibley Care Center from **PHI** to **PHI** and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy and also education on dietary modification. During her hospital course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. She was started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy. She also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24. She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit. Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping diuretics. Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more with assistance from a physical therapist around the house. She is not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness of breath. She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month. Medications Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o. q.d., lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o. daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o. q.d., Kayexalate 15 p.o. q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o. q. day, Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o. q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o. q. day and CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s. Physical Examination On physical examination her weight is 326 pounds. Her blood pressure is 150 110, on repeat per M.D. 150 100, pulse is 80. Her skin is without any rashes or ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present. Heart regular rhythm, distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2. Her lungs are clear, there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well healed. Her extremities are without any edema. Her O2 sat on room air is 98%. Diagnosis 1) Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery **PHI**. 2) Chronic renal insufficiency. **PHI** MRN # **PHI** **PHI** Page 2 3) Diabetes mellitus. 4) Anemia of chronic disease. 5) Obstructive sleep apnea. 6) Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia. 7) Hypertension. 8) Morbid obesity. Plan 1) Coronary artery disease status post CABG. She is clinically doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure or angina. Her ejection fraction significantly improved postoperatively. I am concerned about a relatively high blood pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation. I will increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch of her potassium. 2) Chronic renal insufficiency. Again we'll check regular labs once to twice weekly monitoring renal function. 3) Diabetes mellitus. Stable. Her blood pressure have been under fairly good control. She has also lost a significant amount of weight over 20 pounds. Her current weight is 326 pounds. We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw. 4) Anemia of chronic disease. We'll also recheck her blood count and follow up. 5) Obstructive sleep apnea. The patient is using her CPAP machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so. 6) Hyperkalemia. She will continue with the Kayexalate as prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium regularly over the next several months until they normalize. 7) Morbid obesity. She is making good progress with her weight loss. She is going to continue on an out patient program once weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on a successful weight loss plan. **PHI** MRN # **PHI** **PHI** Page 3 She will follow up with me in one month's time. **PHI**, M.D. DD **PHI** DT **PHI** DV **PHI** **PHI** cc **PHI**, M.D. Cardiac Surgery FSH **PHI**, M.D. Cardiology Division FSH ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
