He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted , particularly in the hot weather , a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox , or across a large parking lot , such as Grand Union . At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two , and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed . He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year . He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions . MEDICATIONS 1 . Aspirin 325 mg daily . 2 . Clopidogrel 75 mg daily . 3 . Atorvastatin 40 mg daily . 4 . Lopid 600 mg b.i.d . 5 . Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily . 6 . Xanax , Benadryl at bedtime , multivitamin . INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS 1 . Higher dose beta blocker orthostasis . 2 . Lisinopril questionable contribution to orthostasis . On examination , he is comfortable at rest . The blood pressure is 170 100 checked twice , supine , standing it is 160 96 , heart rate 82 and regular , weight 204 pounds , oxygen saturation 98 %. The jugular venous pressure is 5 . The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed . The chest is clear . Cardiac exam shows a grade II VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex . The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly , pulsatile masses or bruits . There is no peripheral pitting edema . The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST T wave abnormalities compared to **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . In summary , Mr. **PHI** has 1 . History of CAD , status placement of a drug eluting stent in the LAD , **PHIDate** , without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction . Repeat cardiac catheterization , **PHIDate** , because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis . 2 . Hypertension , not controlled . His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea . We spoke about the options . As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril , will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure . He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week . To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia , blood studies today will include electrolytes , plasma metanephrine level and TSH . A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of `` fluttering '' which occurs at least nightly . Once his blood pressure is controlled , an exercise test will follow . [ Addendum Holter shows single **PHI** bigeminy at time of his symptoms . Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines . He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the **PHI** 's on **PHI** **PHI** , no further palpitations . He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT ] 3 . Dyslipidemia , on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy . When it is time to renew his Lopid , it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy . A serum CK will be included in today 's blood studies . 4 . Mild mitral regurgitation . It was a pleasure to see Mr. **PHI** today and I will report back to you following his Holter .
