 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor . Briefly , he was admitted **PHI** with DKA and MSSA bacteremia . He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p **PHI** drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on **PHI** and by IR **PHI** , both sites positive for MSSA . Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p **PHI** **PHI** , gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection , splenectomy and primary anastamosis , with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins . He also had **PHI** LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage . He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome , but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin . So he was switched to **PHI** for LUQ abscess . After **PHI** **PHI** of high-dose ambisome , he was taken back to OR on **PHI** for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his **PHI** site that surgeons `` scooped out '' as much as they could , but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions . Given the inability to completely **PHI** resect Mr. **PHI** 's GI mucor despite a **PHI** of Ambisome , he was started on an investigational drug , posaconazole , provided by **PHI** on a compassionate use basis . This has had **PHI** % success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials . He was started on this drug on **PHI** and has tolerated it well despite some nausea , diarrhea . He has been at **PHI** reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip . He walks with a walker . He had repeat CT **PHI** **PHI** which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection . He had abd drains removed **PHI** **PHI** ago but continues to have L hip drain , without much output . He was started on TPN **PHI** week ago due to **PHI** , despite po intake . He has been trying to eat , but reports some nausea and diarrhea , especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole . He reports good glycemic control . He denies **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** .

Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well , but does have significant nausea , somewhat controlled with zofran . Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect , or due to dumping syndrome . Plan : **PHI** ) continue posaconazole **PHI** ) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection **PHI** ) RTC in **PHI** month **PHI** at **PHI** to f/u for posaconazole . Will need EKG again at **PHI** before transfer here . Mr. **PHI** seen and examined with Dr. **PHI** . He is very slowly improving in terms of strength , no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN . Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea , although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects . On balance , if his labs are ok , I 'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings . ECG without QTc prolongation . Abdomen is bening . Left hip still sore , but more and more stable . **PHI** **PHI** , MD
