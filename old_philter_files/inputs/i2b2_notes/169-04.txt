	Reason for visit:

   consulted by Dr Dunham for continuity of care s/p cabg



	Interval History:

   This 53 yo male was referred with DM and CAD who today underwent CABG and CEA with Dr Dunham. Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.



He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance. Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees. He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI. There was global hypokinesis. Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076). There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance. 



He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss. His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved. He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty. Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB. He still feels fatigued throughout the day. He has no orthopnea, PND, abdominal distension, early satiety, abdominal pain or anorexia. He reports BPs are much improved with the addition of Coreg, even as they are running 130-150s/80-100.
