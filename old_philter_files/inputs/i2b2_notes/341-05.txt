Internal Medicine G Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Wilhelm, Goldy

MRN: 9543443

ADMIT DATE: 8/2/98

PCP:  Dr. Casey Frey



HPI: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli. She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX. Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection. Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility. Patient has no complaints. Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills. However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED. 



In the MEDIQUIK ED, she was afebrile with HR 70, BP 150/74, RR 24, and Sa02 100% RA.

U/A: 0-2 RBCs, 20-50 WBCs, moderate squams



EKG: 84bpm, sinus, normal axis, ST elevations in V2-V3 (old)



Imaging: 

CXR (8/2/98): 1.  Increased interstitial markings may represent worsened mild pulmonary edema or interstitial infection.



Abd CT (7/18/98): Near complete resolution of previously seen left lower quadrant fluid collection. Stable small cystic lesions in pancreas which likely represent side branch IPMN.



Abd CT (6/30/98): New 4.8 x 4.0 cm thick walled fluid collection in the LLQ which contains a small amount of gas.  This would be amenable to percutaneous drainage. Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size. Bilateral benign renal cysts. Gallbladder wall calcifications.



A/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. 



1. Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear. It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection. At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI. Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression. 

                - F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures

                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would 

                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)

- Culture if spikes

                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically 

                 improve



2. Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past. During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy. GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy. It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive. 

                - Type and screen

                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement

                - Check post-transfusion Hct 



3. HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents

                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB

                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)

4. Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR. Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding. As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her. 

                - Monitor daily INRs

                - Hold warfarin overnight



5. Renal insufficiency &#8211; Cr 1.58 today (baseline 1.2). Likely secondary to prerenal 

                - Fluid resuscitation 

                - Recheck lytes in AM



6. Diabetes 

                - FSG QAC + HS

                - Lantus + RISS



7. FEN

                - Diabetic diet



8. PPx &#8211; Pboots, teds on R leg
