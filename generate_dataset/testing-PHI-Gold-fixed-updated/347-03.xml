CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
reevaluate Coumadin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.  Last
week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
 It was a very very windy day.  Afterwards she was outside and a
huge gust of wind knocked her over.  Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
the wind blew.  There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode. 
She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
left eyebrow.  She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
lateral edge of her left eyebrow.  She had films of her wrist and
hips both of which were fine.  She has bruising in these areas. 
Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
back to normal.

She had marked hypertension up to 250.  She was treated with
hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
some hematuria.  Her blood pressure at home since then has been
180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.  She
is not on a beta-blocker currently.  She has not had any episodes
of chest pain.  She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., levothyroxine
100 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas. 
She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
weight 148 pounds.
GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
HEENT: PERRL.  Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
eyebrow is easily removed.  No evidence of any infection.  Her
left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
shoulder.  Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
bony step-offs.  She walks well with no pain in her left hip. 
There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
bursa.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
bruising but no more serious complications.  Fortunately she did
not have intracranial bleeding.  I am not sure why her blood
pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
falls verses independent causes.  Given that the high blood
pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
see how well this is working.  Goal BP 140-160 systolic.  Her
urine was checked today.  Hematuria has resolved.  She has 2+
proteinuria.  I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
her hypertension.

We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
and benefits of Coumadin therapy.  Although she is at risk for
falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke. 
She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke. 
I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
hemorrhage and its consequences.  I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
increased risk for falls.  It seems to me that she is in a gray
area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
for Coumadin for her.  She feels very strongly that she wishes to
continue.  This was discussed in detail with her and her
daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.  I
encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall. 
More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
counseling and education.
