BiPAP Reactions to Medicines None Chief Complaint Shortness of breath which is , in fact , chest tightness History of Present Illness This **PHI** year old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on **PHIDate** and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above . He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months . In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest . He is sent by Dr. **PHI** for consideration for coronary angiogram . On **PHIDate** his cholesterol was **PHI** , triglyceride **PHI** , HDL **PHI** and LDL **PHI** . He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar . He 's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells . ROS Const .

He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild . His significant other works as an optician . She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild . Complete Cardiovascular Exam . BP **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** . His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid **PHI** . He has no rales . He has a **PHIDate** aortic ejection murmur , a **PHIDate** MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3 . He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema . EKG NSR **PHI** , LAE , **PHI** Assessment I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR . He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur . In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to **PHI** mg in the morning and again at **PHI** p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day . I will ask him to increase his aspirin to **PHI** mg a day . I will also add fish oil **PHI** mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death . Finally we will double his Zocor to **PHI** mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than **PHI** . I explained the rationale for **PHI** on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery . Of course the catheterization will determine that . He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , Jr., M.D .
