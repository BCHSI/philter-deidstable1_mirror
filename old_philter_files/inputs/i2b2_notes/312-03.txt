Patient Name: 	Ethridge, Clayton

Medical Record #: 	8381729

Attending: 		Dr. Burton



CC/ID:	fever post HD



HPI: 	The patient is a 55 year old male with a past medical history significant for chronic renal failure (secondary to diabetes & hypertension) and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who was recently admitted for a clotted AVF, s/p thrombectomy. Unfortunately, graft eventually reclotted and was deemed unsalvageable- the patient was then started on HD via a tunnelled catheter. Was tolerating this well, until day prior to admission noted a fever prior to going to HD. Blood cultures taken yesterday at HD, returned today with GPC in clusters, further speciation to follow. Admitted for fever workup.

Pt. currently complains of some generalized fatigue, malaise, nausea. Has a hx of abdominal mucormycosis resulting in chronic abdominal discomfort, which today is at baseline. No CP, SOB.

Impression:  55 year old male with chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who is s/p recent tunnelled catheter placement, now presenting with fever post HD, GPC in blood.

ID- Likely catheter related infection, will continue vanco for now, await speciation of GPC. Will recx if spikes above 101.5. FU urine cx. Vanco/Gent. Ultimately needs line out.

ESRD-continue dialysis schedule, will continue nephrocaps, calcitrol, procrit

Hypertension

Will continue outpatient regime

DM- Sliding scale insulin

Heme Protein C and S levels decreased on repeat testing. I believe protein C can be influenced by ESRD, but not protein S. This needs to be followed up further.

Prophylaxis

DVT prophylaxis: 	Fragmin 

GI prophylaxis: 	nexium
