She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally . Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle shaped negatively birefringent crystals , diagnostic of gout . This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation ( ESR CRP ). Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness , she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated . However , her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout . **PHI** Solumedrol 40 mg bid IV , prednisone 40 mg qd starting tomorrow with 12 day outpatient taper ( 40 mg x 3 days , 30 mg x 3 days , 20 mg x 3 days , 10 mg x 3 days ) Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks , then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks Continue to hold HCTZ discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia F u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol ( please arrange appointment w Dr. **PHI** ) Procedure R knee aspiration Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent .
