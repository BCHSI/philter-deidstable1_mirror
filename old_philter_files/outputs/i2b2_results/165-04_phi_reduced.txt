HPI 69 yo F with PMH of DM , HTN , s p MI one year ago , now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days . Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission , when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain , **PHI** . This pain was constant , 24 hours day , and felt like a herd of elephants on my chest . This was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath , especially with exertion , which the patient had not experienced before . The chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night , accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness , I felt like I was about to faint . Patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline . The pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called EMS . Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain . In the **PHI** ED her vital signs were Temp AF , HR 70 , BP 154 79 , RR 20 , satting 99 % RA . EKG showed a new **PHI** inversion in V3 , otherwise at her baseline normal EKG . IV heparin was started for possible MI given her symptoms and history . D dimer was elevated at 782 . Based on these findings and her shortness of breath , **PHI** CT was obtained , which was negative for PE . However , it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size , as well as a 6mm nodule in the LLL . The patient was given ASA , **PHI** , nitro , and made chest pain free in the ED . She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings . ROS No fevers chills . Does report cough , cold sores x 1 week . The patient did report having slight lower quadrant abdominal pain , with some nausea but no vomiting , No hematochezia melena . No increased frequency , no dysuria . No delta MS LOC . Past Medical History CAD s p MI , although unclear when this occurred . ETT 2092 nondiagnostic for ischemia . No evidence of scar or ischemia . Nonspecific apical thinning . Hx TB patient says she was diagnosed at age 19 , received drug therapy and spent time in a sanatorium . Says PPD is always positive , needs CXR to diagnose . hypertension elevated cholesterol trigs 600s , total chol 280s anxiety treated with SSRIs , Klonopin in the past . chronic pain Pt had hx of back surg in the 2080 's for spinal stenosis .

There are several mediastinal lymph nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size . However , in the region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis . These could be reactive or neoplastic . There is a less than 1 cm left hilar node . In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm parenchymal nodule . This is best demonstrated on image 65 . This could possibly represent a malignancy . Alternatively this could represent an intraparenchymal lymph node . This does not appear to touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less likely . Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial right lung base . There is no pneumothorax . No significant pleural fluid is noted . There is no pericardial fluid . IMPRESSION No pulmonary embolism or DVT . There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe . Neoplasm can not be excluded . A follow up chest CT may be further value . These findings were discussed with Dr. **PHI** at the time of dictation . EKG NSR , compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III , however no ST T wave abnormalities , no evidence of infarction . A P Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM , HTN , peripheral neuropathy and s p MI with multiple admissions for rule out , who presents with chest pain , shortness of breath , nightsweats , dizziness , and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X rays . This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways from a cardiac standpoint , as presentation of unstable angina , given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors ; from an oncological standpoint , as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome , given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness , abd pain nausea , chest pain and dyspnea , and the findings in **PHI** CT and **PHI** CT , or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking ; from an infectious disease standpoint , as possible reactivation tuberculosis , given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment . I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies , given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI , has little to no ischemic changes on EKG , and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating . Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB , and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . CV Rate well controlled without medication . Rhythm normal sinus Pump On ACEI , HCTZ for HTN . ischemia on **PHI** statin . Rule out for MI with CMs x 3 . Will obtain stress test in AM . PULM plant PPD send sputum cultures , consider adding AFB . send ANCA follow up CT for nodule nebs O2 therapy to support breathing ENDO urine metanephrines for **PHI** 5HIAA metabolites for carcinoid TSH **PHI** CT for evolution of adenoma holding metformin , will control with **PHI** . **PHI** Nexium holding on fragmin for now low threshold to resume for DVT **PHI** given possible oncologic diagnosis .
