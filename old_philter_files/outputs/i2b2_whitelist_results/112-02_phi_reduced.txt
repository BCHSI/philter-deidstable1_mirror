 Record date : **PHI** BCH Cardiovascular Division CVD R12 **PHI** Cote Avenue **PHI** , CLARENCE **PHI** , OH **PHI** **PHI** ( **PHI** ) **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Law , M.D . **PHI** Memorial Nursing **PHI** Office **PHI** **PHI** Street **PHI** , OH **PHI** Dear Dr. Law : I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. **PHI** in followup in Cardiology today . As you know , he is a **PHI** gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on **PHI** for presyncope and **PHI** on Holter monitoring . His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and asthma . Prior to his pacemaker placement , an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain . He was able to exercise for **PHI** minutes and **PHI** seconds . The test was terminated for **PHI** substernal chest pain , but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted , so we **PHI** with the pacemaker implant . Since the implant Mr. **PHI** describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have **PHI** , however , he has **PHI** that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations , which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker . Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa **PHI** **PHI** pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction . His estimated battery longevity is **PHI** months . The atrial impedance is **PHI** **PHI** , the ventricular impedance is **PHI** **PHI** . The **PHI** is **PHI** mV . The **PHI** is **PHI** mV . The threshold in the atrium is **PHI** V at **PHI** mV , and the threshold in the ventricle is **PHI** V at **PHI** msec . In summary , Mr. **PHI** is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement . His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed . There is no sign of erythema or hematoma . However , his sinus tachycardia is mildly **PHI** . Looking at his heart rate histogram , it appears that this sinus rates have varied from **PHI** beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal . I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia . For this reason , I have performed a TSH today , which is normal , however , I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated . I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time . I plan to see Mr. **PHI** in followup in three months ' time , and if any issues arise in the interim , please do not hesitate to contact me .
