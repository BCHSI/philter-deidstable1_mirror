 Record date : **PHI** CCU JAR Admission Note Name : Urban , **PHI** MRN : **PHI** Date of Admission : **PHI** PCP : Georgia Cards : **PHI** ID : **PHI** y/o man transferred to CCU for wide complex tachyarrhythmia HPI : **PHI** y/o man with no PMH and cardiac risk factors of smoking and family history ( father died of MI at age **PHI** ) who presented to the ED with chest pain . He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia **PHI** years ago . He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least **PHI** **PHI** without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly . At concert on day of admission , he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain , **PHI** , no radiation , associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis . Pt reported some associated back pain with onset , like `` I was being crushed like a sandwich . '' Was not eating at time , not like heartburn , no fevers , chills , cough , or chest trauma . EMT was **PHI** SL ntg relieved pain , was given ASA . On arrival to the ED , he was chest pain free . His HR was **PHI** in normal sinus rhythm . On hindsight , EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III , mm aVF , 1mm STD in I ,? aVL with biphasic T in I , TWI in aVL . He received ASA and **PHI** Cardiac RF include tobacco ( **PHI** ppd x **PHI** yrs ) and early family hx ( Dad died of MI , first MI at **PHI** ). No known HTN , DM , or hyperlipidemia . Course on floor : Seen for initial H & P when patient came to **PHI** . During exam , patient became acutely diaphoretic , appeared uncomfortable , still complaining of CP with some mild back pain . BP : L arm **PHI** , R arm **PHI** . ( **PHI** rpt BPs were equal on both arms within **PHI** mm Hg ) HR bradycardia in high **PHI** , sat **PHI** % 2L . Tele demonstrated sinus **PHI** , then several runs of **PHI** wide QRS **PHI** which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia . Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB , diaphoretic . Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat **PHI** , **PHI** ld EKG repeated , pt was given **PHI** mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine , started on **PHI** . Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU . On arrival to CCU , pt was lethargic and diaphoretic . He denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea . SDU Course : For ventricular ectopy ( likely AIVR in setting of ischemia ), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone . This was tapered off and he had no further ectopy .

There is trace mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler . LEFT ATRIUM There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation . AORTIC VALVE , AORTA , LVOT There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis . The aortic valve is tricuspid . There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler . LEFT VENTRICLE The left ventricular cavity size is normal . The left ventricular systolic function is impaired . The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic with regional variation . The Inferior wall is akinetic . The estimated ejection fraction is **PHI** %. TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC , SVC There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency . RIGHT VENTRICLE The right ventricle is not dilated . The right ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic . PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES There is no evidence of pericardial effusion . Pt was taken to the cath lab **PHI** where his RHC showed RA **PHI** , PA **PHI** , PCWP **PHI** , CO **PHI** . Mild LAD disease , **PHI** % circumflex stenosis , RCA **PHI** % occlusion , stented x3 with dissection of RCA during procedure . He also had transient reocclusion during procedure . TIMI II flow after IC adenosine . IABP and temp wire ( for profound bradycardia ) were placed during procedure . V-gram showed basal inferior AK and anterolateral HK , EF approximately **PHI** %. His peak CK were **PHI** . Because his initial echo showed low EF out of proportion to his ischemic event , other causes of low EF were investigated . His serum Fe was slightly low , TSH was normal , SPEP had several low Igs but no evidence of myeloma . Lipid profile showed Cholesterol **PHI** , Trig **PHI** , HDL **PHI** , LDL **PHI** . HgbA1c was **PHI** . Because of reocclusion during cath , **PHI** workup was sent and was negative ( including lupus anticoagulant , **PHI** panel , HIT ). He continued to have some chest pain **PHI** with mild increase of CK likely d/t distal embolization . He has now been persistently pain-free . His IABP was **PHI** **PHI** . He was continued on ASA , Plavix , Lipitor and **PHI** , Captopril were added and can be **PHI** up . PMH : None per patient . **PHI** : Father as above .
