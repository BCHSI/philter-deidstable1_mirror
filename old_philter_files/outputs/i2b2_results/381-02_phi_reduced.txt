PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS **PHI** Team A Infectious Disease Consultation Patient **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** ( **PHI** , 63I ) ID Fellow **PHI** **PHI** ID Attending **PHI** **PHI** Referring Physician Dr. **PHI** Katz Date of Consult **PHIDate** Reason for Consult DM , chronic R and L. foot ulcerations ; L. foot ulceration with surrounding erythema , pain HPI 50F w longstanding type I DM with retinopathy , nephropathy , autonomic and peripheral neuropathy , recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers , here with a few days of pain , erythema , and swelling around her L. forefoot ulcer . She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations , in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM . She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083 , with poor union , and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &# 8211 ; 4th metatarsals . She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads , with underlying osteomyelitis &# 8212 ; this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics . She underwent **PHI** of her R. foot ulceration in **PHIDate** , OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa . In **PHIDate** , she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting . In **PHIDate** , she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis , along with excision of her 5th metatarsal &# 8212 ; bone cultures grew MSSA . She did well until **PHIDate** , when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot ( calcaneal osteotomy , lateral translation , dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy , and **PHI** lengthening ). She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration , and in **PHIDate** , underwent debridement of this ulceration , removal of a screw , and placement of a vacuum sponge . Her wound continued to heal poorly , and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting . In **PHIDate** , she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft , which has taken well ; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely . During her long hospitalization in **PHIDate** , she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations . She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed , and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure , which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically . These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months , and she presented with cellulitis of this area in **PHIDate** . She received vancomycin , levofloxacin , flagyl initially , then augmentin , with persistent poor healing of her wounds . On **PHIDate** , she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer &# 8212 ; she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow **PHI** tissue underlying her L. heel eschar , which was extensively debrided ; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively . She had an angiogram on **PHIDate** , which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE , and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial **PHI** graft . She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently ; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed , and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously . Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past . Over the past 2 3 days , she developed fairly acute swelling , erythema , and pain around her forefoot ulcer , with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot . She was seen in vascular surgery clinic , and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement . She has a chronic &# 8216 ; fast heartbeat ,&# 8217 ; denies any systemic symptoms ( no fevers , chills , sweats , notable weight changes ), headaches , sinus symptoms , sore throat , cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , blood in her bowel movements , dysuria , frequency , LE edema , rashes , myalgias , or new arthralgias . She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin .

Awaiting debridement today , need to determine depth of her infection and whether it extends to bone &# 183 ; Continue vancomycin 1g IV bid for now . Her renal function is impaired from her DM &# 8212 ; would check a vancomycin trough prior to her next dose . &# 183 ; Please send biopsy of bone underlying her L. forefoot ulcer for gram stain , aerobic culture , and anaerobic culture from OR today . &# 183 ; Needs to be on MRSA contact precautions &# 8212 ; grew abundant MRSA from her R. groin wound last month . &# 183 ; Has missed her follow up mammogram appointments and colonoscopy appointments for follow up of an abnormal lumpectomy finding and a &# 8216 ; precancerous polyp &# 8217 ; because of her recent foot issues . Unable to stand for mammography because of her foot issues &# 8212 ; will discuss optimal imaging of her L. breast with breast radiology , will hopefully be able to obtain this study during this hospitalization . Discussed with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , ID Attending . Recommendations discussed with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** of primary team .
