HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS He has seen Dr. **PHI** **PHI** and a prostate biopsy has been recommended . This is scheduled for next week and Mr. **PHI** is quite anxious about it . He began the Captopril and HCTZ (? or **PHI** ) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH . At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved . He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself . His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting . On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170 . He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this . He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On examination today he looks well and comfortable . His blood pressure is 140 76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68 . His weight is 173 ( stable ). IMPRESSION Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program . Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program . We will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today . He will return in four months for follow up . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Labs Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0 . Will check re HCTZ vs **PHI** .
