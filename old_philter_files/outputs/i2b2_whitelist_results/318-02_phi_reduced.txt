The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday . The session was uneventful , and he finished dialysis around **PHI** pm . Around **PHI** pm , he started **PHI** **PHI** jerky movements of his jaw , arms , and legs . He was unable to stand by himself , and had difficulty with any motor activity . It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself , and needed help from his wife to do so . The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better , and his daughter called his PCP 's office today , at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED . He has had a similar episode like this before in January of **PHI** , when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a **PHI** three day weekend when he went without dialysis ( see note in LMR by neurology consultant ). It was **PHI** at that time that his myoclonus was due to electrolyte disarray , and he was admitted to **PHI** and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms . He has been symptom-free since that time . He reports no other new events . He denies any new medications . Past Medical History : **PHI** .)
