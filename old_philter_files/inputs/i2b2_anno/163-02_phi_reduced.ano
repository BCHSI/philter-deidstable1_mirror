 Record date **PHI** Fairview Lakes Regional Medical Center **PHI** ASB II, 9st Xloor **PHI** **PHI**, KY **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** **PHI**, KY **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI**, **PHI** will be seeing you sometime in **PHI** for primary care. I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues. She comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face. Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ. She has been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had planned. However, she has other medical problems which I will deal with until she sees you. At her last visit, there was a question of PMR and she had "25 shots" of steroids but I have not given her steroids and she has done reasonably well. However, she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra. Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces her pain. She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. HEENT was otherwise unremarkable. I obtained blood studies which revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62 and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8 with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin creatinine of 14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9. A1c pending. A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did not reveal proteinuria or sediment. HBsAG and HCV are pending as well. I will be in touch with her regarding these results. I was wondering if you could see her sooner than **PHI** because of these abnormalities outlined. Thanks for letting me participate in her care.
