He had recently returned home from grocery shopping , carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment , and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat . He immediately felt lightheaded , disoriented , nauseous , generally weak , and as though he was about to faint . He was able to walk a few steps , sit down , and rest for 15 20min before he realized his symptoms were n't resolving , called his sister , and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak . He denied any CP , SOB , palpitations , flushes , fever chills , HA , visual changes , vomiting , and focal weakness associated with the episode . He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids , had no recent infections cough rhinorrhea , had no weight loss , and no exposures . When his sister arrived he told her to call 911 , and soon he was brought to the SOH ED . One month PTA , Mr. **PHI** had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping . Five minutes later while getting into his car , he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness , falling to the ground with no head trauma . As with today 's episode , he denied prior CP , SOB , palpitations and other symptoms previously listed . According to his sisters who were present at the time , he regained consciousness 2 minutes later , and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him . He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel . He was brought to the ED , where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126 61 and HR 66 , and was admitted for observation and workup . **PHI** CT was negative for an acute process , CXR was clear , EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST **PHI** changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago , negative cardiac enzymes , and a cardiac echo showing mild MR , an elongated LA , and an EF of 68 %. At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax . In the past month , Mr. **PHI** has had no repeat syncopal episodes , but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness . He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities , or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets . He has had no other symptoms . Of note , this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue , and resumed taking 4mg of **PHI** Prazosin for his BPH around 6am . He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off ' in an unidentifiable way . Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded 'woozy ', sometimes worse with positional changes , and still generally weak , with no other symptoms . PMH DM2 diagnosed 2080 , initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo , but since has been managed by diet and exercise only . HbA1c checked q3mo ; most recent was around 5.0 per pt .
