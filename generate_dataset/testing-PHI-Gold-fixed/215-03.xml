Assessment: 58 year-old man with a history of CAD CHF, and OSA who presents with weakness, weight loss, SOB, and ARF in the setting of increased diuretic use.   



Plan:

1.	ARF: 

-responding to slow hydration, will aim for euvolemia and hold diuresis and ACE-I. Gentle IVF at this time given tenuous balance between being dry and volume overloaded, will reassess volume status in the AM along with AM lytes

-hold lasix, ACE-I

-Urine lytes obtained in the ED difficult to interpret in the setting of diuretic use

-check Urine Eos (per attg)

-Renal U/S (per attg)

-treat UTI (levoflox x 10 D), f/u UCx

2.	HTN

-continue lopressor, hold Cartia XT and Altace

3.	SOB: Expected improvement in symptoms with diuresis but patient actually reports worsening of SOB.  Last ECHO demonstrated normal RSVP but concern now for progressive primary pulmonary process contributing to R heart failure not L sided dysfunction.

-repeat ECHO in the AM 

4.	DM

-holding metformin in the setting of ARF

-half home NPH dose with SSI

5.	CAD

-hold lipitor given renal failure,

-continue ASA, toprol, 

6.	Dispo

-Return to home
