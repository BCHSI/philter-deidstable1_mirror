 Record date **PHI** ENT **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHIDate** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** Memorial Hospital **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** **PHI** did see **PHI** **PHI** for a followup today . As you know , I did see her back in **PHI** where she was diagnosed with possible right sided eustachian tube dysfunction . Her blood sugars have been under reasonably good control , 88 and then 300 . She reports that her hearing has continued to fluctuate . When questioned , she reports that she only used the nose spray twice since I did prescribe it . On examination today , she otherwise appears well . Ears are unremarkable . Her eardrums are intact . She has no tympanosclerosis or cholesteatoma . Her gait is normal . There is no nystagmus . An audiogram done today does show a sloping high frequency sensorineural hearing loss , which is symmetric . Her discrimination scores are 100 % in the right ear and 100 % in the left ear . Assessment Mild ear fullness with dysequilibrium and blockage . Plan She does take multiple medications . It continues to be very unclear to me what her underlying causality is . I would like her to use the nasal spray more consistently . If she does fail this and this is not eustachian tube dysfunction , I would consider her to have endolymphatic hydrops . This would respond hopefully to a diuretic and potassium supplementation . However , she has taken multiple medications currently for both blood pressure including atenolol , Cozaar , Lasix , and verapamil . I would need to clear to switch herself ???? therapy , I would like to see her back after consistent trial of the corticosteroid spray topically .
