HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was examined and 
treated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the history is as 
follows:  The patient is a 47 year old male with end stage renal 
disease on hemodialysis who was referred for abdominal discomfort 
and fever.  His abdominal discomfort had begun within the preceding 
24 hours and had gradually worsened.  He had pain in the left lower 
quadrant radiating to the rectal area.  He did have one diarrheal 
bowel movement.  He specifically denied bleeding. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was awake 
and alert, although somewhat sluggish and apparently uncomfortable. 
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure was 177/90, pulse 117, initial 
temperature 103.3, respiratory rate 20.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal. 
Sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx showed normal architecture. 
NECK:  Supple.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS: 
The breath sounds were essentially clear.  ABDOMEN:  There was mild 
to moderate diffuse tenderness.  No definite mass can be 
appreciated.  Bowel sounds were diminished.  RECTAL:  Stool is 
guaiac-negative, per the resident's examination.  EXTREMITIES: 
Examination of the left thigh showed slight drainage at a recent 
surgical incision site. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes showed sodium 139, potassium 
4.3, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 12, creatinine 2.2, glucose 230. 
White blood cell count was 30,000, hematocrit 38.  Chest x-ray 
showed no definite infiltrate.  Abdominal x-ray showed dilated 
loops of small bowel.  EKG showed no change from previous tracings. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The assessment and plan were 
reviewed with the resident. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  I confirm the provisional diagnosis of abdominal 
pain with question of deep venous thrombosis versus sepsis from as 
yet unidentified source. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The care plan 
was reviewed.  The patient was started on antibiotics and 
ultimately admitted to the hospital for definitive evaluation and 
further care.
