As you recall he is a 71 year old gentleman who is status post angioplasty on the left for high grade stenotic lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery on the left. The patient presents now for further evaluation of his "claudication symptoms". The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms, there are about equivalent in nature. He has very minimal low back pain. He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to be associated with some abnormal gait. He states on a bad day its about a 9 10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as high as 8 9 10. The episodes are almost daily and are brought on by things like walking. He can walk less than one block at which point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow shuffling and occasionally falling. When he is having severe symptoms he notes his legs to be weak. He denies any bowel or bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy. He has very little back pain associated with his symptomatology. He has had no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections. He describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension. Years ago he stated he was in excellent health. His weight is steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss. He doesn't smoke and drinks socially. Quit smoking 33 years ago. He does not think he will ever be pain free. Review of Systems Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic and he has been for the past couple of years. He has difficulty with sleep. He has a balance problem and also has benign prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection, for this he takes Cardura. He has a history of high blood pressure. Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality. No respiratory malfunction. He has had surgery for something "in his colon" he has also had a bypass surgery. He is on Plavix and aspirin. Physical Examination Shows that he is solid built, healthy appearing male. He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left side his T band seems to be slightly weak. Single toe raises show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg. He has no tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs. He has negative Trendelenburg bilaterally. Forward flexion allows him to get to the patella. Extension is pain free and passive hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms. Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities. Sensory is symmetric. He has negative straight leg raises. He has no palpable pulses. He is hairless in his lower extremities. He had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting that he is not myelopathic despite his "balance abnormality". He is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes, and for his gastroesophageal reflux. Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in his iliac artery on the right. CT scan shows lumbosacral facet hypertrophy. At this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative disk disease. I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to see me after that. Thanks for the referral. **PHI**, M.D. Dictated By **PHI** eScription document **PHI** EFFocus DD **PHI** DT **PHI** DV **PHI**
