HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT This 49 year old man has been complaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours. He came in complaining of that plus some nausea and was found to have a highly elevated glucose and was sent over here. The patient denies any chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he feels poorly. Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood sugar was noted to be greater than 600. The patient does not complain of blurry vision and does not complain of light headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS As per the resident's note. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Cardiomyopathy. Otherwise, as per the resident's note. SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY As per the resident's note. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Significant findings include a pulse of 76, respirations 22. The patient appears to be in no acute distress. The lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung. There is jugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw. Cardiac examination is otherwise normal. Abdominal examination is within normal limits. The patient has a colostomy. The patient has a left below knee amputation and toe digit toe amputation on the right side. Otherwise, there are no musculoskeletal abnormalities. There are some decubitus ulcers which are stable. LABORATORY EVALUATION Laboratories are significant for a glucose of 934, sodium 127, anion gap 17, bicarb 19, creatinine and BUN 5.8 and 37, hematocrit 30, which is not too different from his usual. His pH is 7.42. CK is 54, but troponin is 1.45. Of note, however, the patient does have renal conditions. EKG shows new deep Qs in 2, 3, and F compared to one done a month ago. Chest x ray shows some excess interstitial markings indicative of increased fluid. THERAPY RENDERED COURSE IN ED This patient appears to have congestive heart failure. He may be having new cardiac event, although after a consultation with the Integra Health cardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, but rather due to axis deviation. The patient is being treated for his hyperglycemia and is being admitted. FINAL DIAGNOSES 1. Rule out myocardial infarction. 2. Hyperglycemia. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge) The patient was admitted to the hospital in stable condition. **PHI** **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** D **PHI** T **PHI** Dictated by **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
