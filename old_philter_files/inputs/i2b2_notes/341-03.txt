HPI: 73 yo black woman with h/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue, weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on 6/2-6/20/97. At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss. 

In early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes. The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma. Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV. The patient   s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.

Axillary lymph node biopsy 6/08/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process. Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population. Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities.  The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced. On 7/19/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed. Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia. Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization. 
 
Since discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not    felt like eating.    She reports significant acid reflux, saying    only water goes down    and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth. She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure/day per her family. She further denies N/V, diarrhea, fever/chills/dizziness or recent infection. Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes. She has not had a bowel movement for several days. She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.

In addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization. She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household. She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping, relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally. She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game. She denies suicidal ideation, saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for.
   
ED COURSE: At the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR 59, BP 136/61, RR 16, O2 Sat 95%. She was given IVF and labs were drawn.

ECG: NSR @ 82bpm, LVH unchanged from prior study


Impression: 
73F h/o newly dx HOCM, chronic systemic LAD, fatigue, and weight loss concerning for sarcoid vs. PBC vs. neoplasm, presenting with acute renal failure in setting of little PO intake and likely hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia (as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis, with dehydration, anorexia, constipation, and PUD, fatigue and depression. This would thus represent a unifying diagnosis for this pt   s anorexia and acute renal failure, which is most likely prerenal.

Plan: 
ARF: - f/u Ca + Phos. Expect Ca to be high, Phos to be low. Cont IVF
   - Cre 2.2   1.8 (bl 1.2-15) s/p IVF 500cc x1, on D5    NS @ 100cc/hr, re-evaluate and re-bolus in AM
          - Maintain good UO, no Foley b/c recording stricts I   s + O   s, 700cc out of clear urine O/N
Fatigue/Weight Loss/LAD/lack of appetite: 
-prior labs somewhat concerning for PBC, esp with elev AlkP
-f/u anti-mitochondrial Ab, TSH, f/u pending labs from prior w/u
-consider re-attempting transbronchial biopsy, revisit w/ thoracics 
Anemia: -Hct stable, slightly microcytic. MVI
