Mr. **PHI** has a primary cardiologist ( Dr. **PHI** ) in Gloucester and has received much medical care at Oregon City Hospital . He has been followed by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC . He was admitted to GNC from **PHI** to **PHI** after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension , fatigue , and nausea ; this was **PHI** **PHI** after the placement of his BiV ICD . He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered , but developed a marked transaminitis . Due to elevated filling pressures ( PCWP **PHI** ), he required IV Lasix for diuresis . He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure , so transplantation was instead **PHI** . He was also admitted to GNC from **PHI** through **PHI** after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue ( PCWP **PHI** ); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside . At the time of discharge , his reported dry weight was **PHI** lbs . He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue . He reports that he has been feeling &# **PHI** ; lousy ,&# **PHI** ; that his appetite has been &# **PHI** ; **PHI** ,&# **PHI** ; and that he is &# **PHI** ; feeling real tired.&# **PHI** ; He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past **PHI** years . He denies overt shortness of breath , but essentially **PHI** very easily with physical exertion , and has been requiring multiple **PHI** a day . He states that he has been careful with his diet ( both fluid and salt intake ) without any changes , and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications . Of note , his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago , and that seems to have made him feel worse . He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing . He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure , and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering ; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in **PHI** . He says that his pacemaker was &# **PHI** ; checked &# **PHI** ; last week and that he was told he **PHI** &# **PHI** ; t have any &# **PHI** ; episodes.&# **PHI** ; He believes that he has been putting on weight recently , and reports that his baseline weight is **PHI** lbs . He denies recent fevers or chills . He has no complaint of leg swelling .

It **PHI** into the LAD and LCX coronary arteries . Left main coronary artery is normal . LAD : The Proximal LAD has a diffuse , irregular , and thrombotic **PHI** % stenosis in its proximal third . D1 has a focal **PHI** % stenosis in its ostium . The Ramus has a focal **PHI** % stenosis in its ostium . Both the D1 and Ramus side branches arise from the thrombotic proximal LAD segment . Left Circumflex : The left circumflex coronary artery is moderate sized vessel , which gives origin to two obtuse marginal arteries . The artery contains only minimal irregularities . RCA : The right coronary artery is a large vessel . The artery contains only minimal irregularities . TTE ( **PHI** ) Moderate MR with e/o elevated LA pressure . Dilated LV with severe diffuse hypokinesis ( with some preservation of mid-septal , inferior , and lateral segments ). EF **PHI** %. Moderate TR . RVSP **PHI** mmHg . Dilated RV with diffuse hypokinesis . Thallium Myocardial Imaging ( **PHI** ) The myocardial scans show apical and distal inferior infarction . The remainder of the myocardium is viable .
