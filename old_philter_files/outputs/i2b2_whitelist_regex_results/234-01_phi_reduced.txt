Mrs. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** is a **PHI** year old Hispanic female who presents with a new onset acute MI . She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease , but has a **PHI** history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension . She had been in her usual state of health until about **PHI** **PHI** ago , when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort . She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission , when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath . She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new onset ST segment elevation in the inferior leads with a **PHI** morphology involving the lateral leads as well . There was also poor R wave progression V1 through V3 . She was taken **PHI** to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at **PHI** mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure . She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation . There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex . The right coronary artery was small with a **PHI** % proximal stenosis . The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug eluting stent . She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to **PHI** mmHg . She had an estimated **PHI** % ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis . Cardiac index was **PHI** with SVR of **PHI** . She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation . Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril **PHI** mg q.d . and atenolol **PHI** mg q.d . She also has insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin . Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy . Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use . She is from Paraguay and has recently **PHI** in this country . Review of systems show no fever , chills , nausea , or vomiting . On exam , she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially **PHI** **PHI** with a heart rate of **PHI** and regular . Followup pressure **PHI** **PHI** with a heart rate of **PHI** beats per minute . Head and neck were unremarkable . Chest is clear . Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at **PHI** degrees . PMI is normal . S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split . There is an S4 and a **PHIDate** systolic ejection murmur as well as a **PHI** to **PHIDate** holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border . There is no S3 . Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly . Bowel sounds are normal . Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis . Calf site is clean without **PHI** . Distal pulse is decreased but palpable . Her resting **PHI** lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI . Other lab values included creatinine **PHI** with normal electrolytes , hematocrit is **PHI** %, white blood cell count **PHI** with platelets **PHI** . Liver function tests are normal . A portable chest x ray shows pulmonary edema . Mrs. **PHI** **PHI** clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation . She has had her circumflex , which is a very large vessel , well treated now with a drug eluting stent , and her wedge has come down , and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved . At this point , we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin , Plavix , heparin , continue the **PHI** , as well as Lasix and nitrates . We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated , and also plan beta blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen **PHI** . She certainly has co existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD . At this point , if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia , we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery . **PHI** Ferris , MD Dictated By **PHI** Ferris eScription document **PHI** BFFocus DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
