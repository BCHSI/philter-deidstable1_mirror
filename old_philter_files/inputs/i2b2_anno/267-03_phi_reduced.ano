She comes in with an acute headache this morning, followed by a syncopal event, which lasted approximately five seconds. Currently, she is complaining of intermittent chest pain and a continuing headache across her head and down to her eyes. PAST MEDICAL and SURGICAL HISTORY The past history is notable for her CABG, as well as for a history of temporal arteritis. MEDICATIONS She was on prednisone, which was recently stopped.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On physical examination, she is an elderly black female in no acute distress. She has a temperature of 100 degrees F., a pulse of 90, and a blood pressure of 150 70. The O2 saturation is 97% on room air. The examination is notable for a surgically altered pupil in the right eye, which is non reactive. The extraocular movements are intact. She has no palpable temporal or skull tenderness. The lungs show rhonchorous breath sounds throughout. The cardiovascular examination shows a midline scar, with a regular rate and rhythm and no murmur. The abdomen is soft and non tender. The extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The neurologic examination is grossly intact. THERAPY RENDERED COURSE IN ED This is an elderly female status post recent CABG, who had a syncopal episode this morning after complaining of a headache. The plan at this time is to obtain a head CT to rule out an intracerebral process. She has had an EKG, which does show some T wave changes, different from when she was here for her CABG. She will also have cardiac enzymes sent and will be admitted to the hospital for further monitoring of her syncopal event. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge) As above. The patient's condition on admission is stable. **PHI** **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** D **PHI** T **PHI** Dictated by **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
