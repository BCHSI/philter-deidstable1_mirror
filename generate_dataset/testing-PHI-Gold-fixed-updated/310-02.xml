 MANAMANA nfectious Disease Consultation Note

Patient: Vincent Ware (71417347     2Y)
Student:  Casey Best, MS-4
ID Fellow: Tina Isaiah-Villagomez MD
ID Attending: Alexander Y Xian MD
Referring Physician: Webster MD
Date of Consult: September 20, 2073

Reason for consult:  cough, nightsweats and weightloss, two days prior to transplant

HPI: 66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome.  He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066.  He was free of disease since then until May 2073.  He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31).  His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome.  He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant.  His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073.   It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down.  And only occasionally does he produce any sputum.  He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare-Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of July).  In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis.  In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro.  On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase    conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity.      CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.  

Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced.  He recalls    nightsweats    as the fevers broke.  He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months.  He denies SOB (unless he   s severely anemic), orthopnea, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, CP, palpitations, angina-like symptoms, acid-reflux, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, dysuria, frequency, nocturia, joint or muscle pain.  He does have mild peripheral neuropathy in his feet bilaterally.

09/19/2073 Chest PA &amp; Lateral  
      IMPRESSION: Chest PA and lateral views are compared to prior  done on 9/18/2073. Paramediastinal opacification is changed.  Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable. Nodular opacity in the  left perihilar region appears less apparent. No new consolidations are seen. There is a new left-sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC. No pneumothorax is seen .
      
Impression:
66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.

The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.  Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP.  However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.  Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.  While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.  

I (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.   My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP.  An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious).  Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.    

 We recommend the following work-up:

-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture
-Induced sputum for
-PCP
-Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)
-Fungal stain and culture
-Urine histo antigen
-Serum cryptococcal antigen
-Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan
-Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture

If the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.

It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).

Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.  Thank you for this consult.  Our team will follow with you
