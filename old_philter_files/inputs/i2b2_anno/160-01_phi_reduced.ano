 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** CARDIOLOGY OFFICE NOTE NOTE Ms. **PHI** returns after a 4 year hiatus. She is now 52 and has long standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h o retinopathy OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy. She had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally well since that time. Over the past year she has not been as careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her sugars regularly. A random cholesterol w i the past year was over 300. She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis or light headedness. There has not been any reduction in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year ago and is working full time. There has been no orthopnea, PND or peripheral edema. She is interested in increasing her physical activity program. Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age 20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's. She is perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her gynecologist Dr. **PHI**. Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day. EXAM She is comfortable at rest. BP 110 76, HR 80 and reg. No JVD. Carotids full w o bruits. Chest clr. Cardiac exam shows normal heart sounds w o gallop or murmur. Abd. soft w o organomegaly. No peripheral edema. Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis and is a normal tracing. For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed using the standard bruce protocol. She exercised for 9 minutes, 8 seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of chest pain or inordinate dyspnea. Peak heart rate was 143 (85% maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure. There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work load. Compared to the test of **PHI** she exercised 1 minute, 4 seconds longer. IMPRESSION 1. No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time. She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, family h o coronary disease and a perimenopausal state. She will be seeing Dr. **PHI** as her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid profile be obtained and that dietary pharmacologic therapy be PAGE 2 **PHI** **PHI** instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130. From a cardiac standpoint, post menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired. Low dose aspirin therapy could also be considered. I would be happy to see Ms. **PHI** for additional cardiac evaluation as needed in the future.
