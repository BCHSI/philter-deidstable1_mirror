REVIEW OF STUDIES Blood studies on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** were satisfactory except for a BUN of 41 with a creatinine of 1.3 . I assume that that will be part of the checking up , which Dr. **PHI** will be doing . A chest CT scan on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** showed no change in the small mediastinal nodes , but I will plan , just to be sure , to do a chest CT scan and an abdominal CT scan in six months . If those studies are stable and satisfactory , I discussed with Mr. **PHI** the fact that I may not do scans subsequently given the absence of activity of lymphoma , the importance of his other medical conditions , and his advancing age . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Weight 175 lb . with shoes .
