CCU Course/Plan:  



Ischemia:  Patient was taken to cath lab on 12/03/73 and found to have 3-V CAD (70% prox LAD, 60% LCx, occluded RCA).  He was transferred to the CCU (intubated) but with diuresis he was weaned and extubated on 12/04/73.  He continued to be medically managed with ASA/Plavix (on hold now for anticipated surgery), Statin (lipitor 80 mg po qhs), BB (lopressor 50 mg po q6h), and ACE-I (captopril 6.25 mg po tid started on 12/05/73).  He is awaiting CABG but does not have good conduits as expected given his extensive PVD.  Plastic surgery is evaluating patient for potential grafts.  CNI pending pre-op.



Pump: Patient was quickly weaned off all pressors.  TTE was obtained on 12/05/73.  EF was 38%, mild MR, LA dilatation, LV is dilated and fxn is moderately impaired (inf/post/lat dysfunction).  There were echodensities noted in the LV apex which may be trabeculations, however, thrombus cannot be excluded.  He has received prn doses of lasix (responds to 80 IV) and we are continuing his BB and ACE-I.  Goal TBB is ~-1.0 L.



Rhythm: Stable, continuing BB, Telemetry.



Resp: Stable, s/p extubation.  On NC with sats > 95%.  Continue diuresis and f/u CXRs.



PVD/LE: Unsuccessful attempt at percutaneous revascularization of his RLE.  Limb is currently not threatened and he has dopplerable pulses.  No plans now for interventions in LE.



ID/WBC: WBC elevated on 12/05/73 but no fevers.  May be due to steroids (was receiving Dex while cort-stim was in process).  This was discontinued.  Cultures all show no growth to date.  Continue to trend WBCs.



Proph: Heparin gtt, Nexium.
