 Record date **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHIDate** **PHI** **PHI** Ishikawa , M.D . Surgery **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear **PHI** , I had the pleasure of seeing **PHI** **PHI** in Internal Medicine today . She was seen alongside my attending , Dr. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** . As you know , she is a lovely 52 year old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery . She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment . Ms. **PHI** tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and peripheral arterial disease . She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities . Specifically , she is status post a right fem pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem DP bypass also in 2066 . It appears that her right graft has been functioning well , but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago . She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe . You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday . Ms. **PHI** tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease . She has never had any chest discomfort , shortness of breath , orthopnea , PND , lower extremity edema , palpitations , lightheadedness , or syncope . She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI . She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI . She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD . In terms of her functional capacity , she tells me that up until a year ago , she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever . Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity , she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise . She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath . She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain . Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump , peripheral arterial disease , status post bilateral lower extremity bypass , hypertension , and hyperlipidemia . Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg , which she started a few days ago , Lipitor 10 mg once daily , Diovan 160 mg twice daily , vitamin C , vitamin B and folic acid supplementation . She has no clear drug allergies , but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet . She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years , one pack per day in her early 20s . She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in **PHI** . As I mentioned previously , her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s . On physical examination , her blood pressure is 135 79 , heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds . In general , she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest . She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water . She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits . Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally . Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally . Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , and a soft **PHIDate** systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border . Her abdomen is benign . She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta . Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage , which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe . Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral , absent popliteal and absent distal pulses . In her right lower extremity , she has 1+ femoral , with no bruit , 2+ popliteal , 2+ DP and 1+ PT . An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation . There is left atrial enlargement and Q waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI . There are also Q waves in lead III and aVF , which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI . In summary , Ms. **PHI** is a lovely 52 year old female with longstanding diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft . She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago . However , I am concerned by her electrocardiogram , which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction . As such , I think that it would be **PHI** to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery . Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently , I do not think that we need to delay her surgery . However , I would start her on a beta blocker and as such , I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily , which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period . During the perioperative period , we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120 80 and a goal heart rate less than 60 . I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes . We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning . If we are unable to do arm exercise , we will obtain an adenosine MIBI . I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed . As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good , I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results . This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease . It was a pleasure seeing Ms. **PHI** in clinic today . We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise . Please feel free to contact me with any questions .
