HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS This 61 year old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. **PHI** for followup of possible stroke or TIA . The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed . In **PHI** , she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning . There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg . This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion , she fell getting out of bed . The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated . She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected , she feels that the event has not re occured . The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well . She was seen by Neurology on **PHIDate** after she was admitted . The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report . Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe . Also , in the record is noted that at the time of the second event , her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with **PHI** . There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event . On examination at the time of admission , there were no clear findings . MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes . The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage . MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes . Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt . Currently , the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup . It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was . Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA . Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor . There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough . The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills . There are no medication allergies reported . PAST FAMILY SOCIAL HISTORY Past medical history is notable for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , spinal stenosis , diabetes , depression , neuropathy , anxiety , COPD , arthritis , and sinus symptoms . MEDICATIONS Lisinopril , Lopressor , glyburide , Naprosyn , Neurontin , Paxil , Lescol , Advair , trazodone , Glucophage , and ??. Not withstanding the above , the patient continues to smoke . She uses alcohol occasionally . She has a 12th grade education . She lives alone and is a widow . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure is 148 86 , pulse 83 and regular , respirations 20 . The patient is overweight . Height is 5 foot 3 inches . Weight is 217 pounds . Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants , though without clear spasm . Poor neck posture is noted . Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels . Cardiovascular testing , carotids are 2+ without bruits . Temporal arteries are normal . Musculoskeletal testing , gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years . Romberg is negative . Tandem gait is normal . The patient does move slowly in general , this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia . There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left . This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic . There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted . NEUROLOGICAL TESTING Mental status is essentially normal to orientation , memory , attention , language and fund of information . Cranial nerve testing , pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive . Extraocular movements are full . Visual fields are intact . There is no facial sensory loss , but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological . Visual fields are intact . Hearing is intact . Oropharynx is normal . Palate elevates well . Tongue is **PHI** . Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact . Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities . There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing . Coordination testing today seemed intact . Prior neurologic evaluation from **PHIDate** is reviewed . Homocystine level was elevated at 14 , normal zero to ten . Recommended treatment included folate , pyridoxine , and B12 . IMPRESSION Transient neurologic symptoms , question etiology . Comment . I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress . I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant . Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature . In this regard , the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant . It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage . PLAN Although , she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent . She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure . We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily . We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox . It probably does not matter which medication she chooses ; however , she should be on one or the other and not both . For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation , we have added simply multivitamins two daily . I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms . She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly . We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , MD eScription document **PHI** IL DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
