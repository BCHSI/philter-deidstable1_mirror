Pt appears alert , oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital . Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use .

Instructed pt that she must a. report all pre meal bolus doses to the RN so that it can be documented on the flow sheet . b. have blood **PHI** checked as ordered using the hospital approved glucose meter . c. alert RN if she feel uncomfortable using insulin pump . RN should page HO and or diabetes dept immediately for orders for SC insulin . d. agree to discontinue insulin pump and start SC insulin if **PHI** necessary by house staff . Pt **PHI** to all of the above . **PHI** . Monitor blood **PHI** at least before all meals and at bedtime . Please also check blood **PHI** with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt 's request . Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet . **PHI** . For procedure today , I spoke with **PHI** **PHI** and asked that blood **PHI** be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than **PHI** . If BG less than **PHI** , monitor blood **PHI** every **PHI** minutes . Treat BG less than **PHI** with **PHIDate** amp **PHI** and continue to monitor as described above . Do not remove insulin pump . Page **PHIDate** with any concerns during the procedure . Diabetes dept will continue to monitor . Please page **PHIDate** with any questions or concerns .
