CC:         chest pain

  

HPI:

This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain.  She was seated at breakfast this AM when she developed sudden onset ripping chest pain which radiated &#8220;like a knife&#8221; to her upper back.  It was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  It did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new.  It was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths.  It tapered off over about 20 minutes.  She felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes.  She then presented to DCA-ED for evaluation.  She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078.



She has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ANA, anti-smith, anti-dsDNA).  She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs.  She endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.



DCA ED Course:

Initial EKG NSR without ischemic changes

Initial biomarkers strongly positive with CKMB 33 and Troponin 0.36.  CXR unremarkable.

She was treated for NSTEMI with ASA 325 mg X 1, heparin gtt, IV lopressor.

She had a brief episode of CP which was relieved by SL NTG and morphine.

She was sent to SDU for further evaluation and treatment.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.  Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.  TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).  DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).  The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.  Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.  She is currently CP free.



1.    Chest pain

-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now

-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.  Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.

-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult

-     TTE in AM

-     Check amylase, lipase 

-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM

-     Smoking cessation consult



2.    Lupus-like condition

-     Alert rheumatology team to admission in AM



3.    DM

-     Check HbA1c

-     BID NPH and AC+HS RISS



4.    Renal

-     renal prophylaxis give planned dye loads &#8211; mucormyst 1200 BID + IV bicarbonate



5.    Psych

-     continue home regimen &#8211; klonopin, effexor, topamax
