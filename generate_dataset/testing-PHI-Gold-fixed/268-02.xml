INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

HOLDEN DISTRICT HOSPITAL



Reason for visit   Three months of followup for multiple medical problems.



History of present illness   Since his last visit, he has started to resume exercising on his treadmill, but has not been watching his weight or diet.



Major Problems

Hyperlipidemia

His most recent labs are within reasonable range with an LDL of 76 and fasting triglycerides 263, which improved from his previous values.  He has been intolerant to Lopid which resulted in pancreatitis.  He has not lost any weight, but has begun to exercise.

Allergic rhinitis

He has chronic postnasal drip and nasal congestion for which he uses Nasonex on a regular basis with some improvement.  He has had no sinus pains, headache, or recent sinusitis.

Cerebrovascular accident

The patient has had no recent neurological symptoms or changes.  He had a mild aphasia which has totally resolved.  He has had no headaches or any focal symptoms.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease

The patient continues on his ranitidine at night with improvement in his intermittent epigastric discomfort.

Sleep apnea

The patient had a sleep study in November 2091 due to excessive fatigue and snoring.  He was noted to have sleep apnea, and CPAP was prescribed.  He has not been using the CPAP since he was recently on vacation, but he plans to start in the near future.  During his sleep study, he was not uncomfortable wearing the mask and hopefully, this will help.

Prostatic carcinoma

The patient is followed regularly by the urologist and last had a visit in January 2092 with PSA in a very good range at less than 0.2.  He has no dysuria, urgency, frequency, or significant nocturia.

Carpal tunnel syndrome

Currently, he does not complain of any pain or paresthesias in his wrists.

Coronary artery disease

The patient has had no angina since his last visit.  He exercises on a treadmill five times a week and can walk up to five miles in any given setting.  He does not have any palpitations, chest pressure, pain, or significant dyspnea on exertion.

Diabetes mellitus

The patient checks his blood sugars at home, and they have been in the 120 range, although he admits to not losing weight and on his recent trip was not exercising as regularly.  He has had no symptoms with hypoglycemia.

Hypertension

The patient monitors his blood pressure closely at home and finds it to be at around 120/70.  He has not had any headaches or any other focal symptoms.

Assessment and plan   The patient's multiple issues were reviewed in detail and his medications were updated.  He remains overweight, and this was discussed with the patient in terms of portion control and continuing his vigorous exercise program.  He will try to lose weight.

Diabetes.  His last hemoglobin A1c was not in adequate control.  In the past, we have tried to increase his Glucophage.  He did not tolerate it due to severe GI upset.  If his sugars remain high, he will need his regimen adjusted.  His eye exam and throat exam are up-to-date and urine for microalbumin was negative.

Coronary artery disease.  No recent angina.  He will continue on his current regimen.

Sleep apnea.  It was highly recommended that he start his CPAP therapy for overall improvement in his health.

Hypertension.  Very well controlled, and no side effects to his current medications.  Laboratory studies were sent, and he will return for followup in three months or sooner if needed.
