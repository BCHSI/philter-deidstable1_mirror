                     AH EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

BRANCH,EARNEST   530-23-69-1                      VISIT DATE: 12/31/82

This patient was seen primarily by Dr. Xavier Whittaker.  I also saw 

the patient, reviewed the resident's note, and discussed evaluation 

and plan. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and nausea.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 49-year-old man has been 

complaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.  He came 

in complaining of that plus some nausea and was found to have a 

highly elevated glucose and was sent over here.  The patient denies 

any chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he 

feels poorly.  Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood 

sugar was noted to be greater than 600.  The patient does not 

complain of blurry vision and does not complain of 

light-headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the resident's note. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.  Otherwise, as per the 

resident's note. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the resident's note. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant findings include a pulse of 76, 

respirations 22.  The patient appears to be in no acute distress.  

The lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung.  There is 

jugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw.  

Cardiac examination is otherwise normal.  Abdominal examination is 

within normal limits.  The patient has a colostomy.  The patient 

has a left below-knee amputation and toe-digit-toe amputation on 

the right side.  Otherwise, there are no musculoskeletal 

abnormalities.  There are some decubitus ulcers which are stable.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratories are significant for a glucose 

of 934, sodium 127, anion gap 17, bicarb 19, creatinine and BUN 5.8 

and 37, hematocrit 30, which is not too different from his usual.  

His pH is 7.42.  CK is 54, but troponin is 1.45.  Of note, however, 

the patient does have renal conditions.  EKG shows new deep Qs in 

2, 3, and F compared to one done a month ago.  Chest x-ray shows 

some excess interstitial markings indicative of increased fluid.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This patient appears to have 

congestive heart failure.  He may be having new cardiac event, 

although after a consultation with the Integra Health

cardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, 

but rather due to axis deviation.  The patient is being treated for 

his hyperglycemia and is being admitted.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Rule out myocardial infarction.

2.  Hyperglycemia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in stable condition.
