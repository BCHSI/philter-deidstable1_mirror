IMPRESSION:

Ms. Stevens is a 64 year old lady with ESRD admitted with hypertension and nausea as well as vomiting. She was quite hypertensive and I would wonder about the effect of BP. She also looks fluid overloaded.


PLAN:


HD x 3 1/4 hours, 2 K, 2.5 Ca
Negative 3 liters
Needs Medication clarification and good BP control.
