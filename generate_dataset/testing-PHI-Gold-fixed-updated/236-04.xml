History of Present Illness	

Jennifer comes in doing well.



She has had little chest pain and has required few nitros.  No chest pain at rest or shortness of breath.



She continues to have significant discomfort from her DM neuropathy.  She has been taking neurontin and has noticed an improvement in this, but the pain does continue to be problematic.  She saw Pearline Rush in neurology who felt that she was not likely to be having seizures, but planned an EEG and MRI to r/o any structural disease.



Seen in GYN for embx which was negative for hyperplasia.  Has not had her period for 3 months.



Seen in ED with a tick bite.  No rashes or joint symptoms.
