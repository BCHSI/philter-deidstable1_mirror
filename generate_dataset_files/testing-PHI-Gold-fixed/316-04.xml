History of Present Illness	

Diabetes= on oral agents- just glyburide 5mg tab bid

No other hypoglycemic episodes



no polyuria,polydipsia,no fevers, no weight loss

We talked again about bringing in his log- 

I suspect he is very out of range but dont know, and his report of sugars of 55 make me concerned about increasing meds.



Still having problems with ulcers - seeing Dr Ulbrich regularly

seeing nurse daily for dressing changes. Has heel pad to remove pressure. Has had shoes checked. Is to see Dr Ulbrich 's nurse today for debridement. Is off antibiotics now; was on ? a few weeks ago?? 



3. edema- good control recently

   taking zaroxylyn and lasix

   better controlled when on both

  on  lisinopril, lasix. not on atenolol - he stopped it because he did not like it, made him feel sleepy. Need to consider increasing bp meds- will await Creatinine tpday
