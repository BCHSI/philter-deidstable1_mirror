B2:          Distal surgical margin.
B3:          Appendix, cross-sections and distal tip, longitudinal.
B4-B5:          Surgical margins, separate small bowel segment.
B6:          Separate small bowel.
B7:          Proximal terminal ileum.
B8:          Middle terminal ileum.
B9:          Distal terminal ileum.
B10:          Ascending colon polyps proximal to mass (smaller *****

Cassettes B1-B4 went well. Cassettes *****-*****, however, failed.
