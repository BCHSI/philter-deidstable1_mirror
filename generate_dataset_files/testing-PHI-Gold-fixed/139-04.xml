NAME:     Upham, Zelda
MRN:      0308696

The patient is here for a scheduled visit, status post hospitalization for emergent
bypass surgery.  She is late for the visit.  She is accompanied by her daughter,
Qazi.  The patient denies chest pain and has done quite well, based on reports
from her rehab stay at the Miller County Hospital.  Currently complaining of
left-sided chest wall pain. No exertional chest pain and no shortness of breath.  Has
an appointment pending with her cardiologist tomorrow.  Also has an appointment
pending with surgeon Dr. Weeks for 12/13/95. Has been compliant with
medications.  

The patient's daughter is concerned that the patient is not eating enough.  Has lost
significant weight since hospitalization.  Patient did agree that she has been watching
what she eats because she did not want to gain much weight.  Explained to her the
importance of proper nutrition and getting back her strength.  

Asked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas. Says that the chest wall
tenderness is very different from any exertional chest pain that she may have had in
the past.  Would like some relief for this.  Uses it on her knees and finds it helpful
for the arthritic knee pain. 

Emotionally, the patient did admit to feeling depressed and did become tearful
during the visit. 

PROBLEMS: See extensive LMR list. 

MEDICATIONS:  See LMR list. 

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Percocet and quinine. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-appearing female. Vital signs: WNL, as per flow
sheet. Lungs: Clear with rales. COR: RRR, S1 and S2 without murmurs noted. 

ASSESSMENT:

(1)  CAD: The patient is also on a cholesterol-lowering agent, but will update list
     at next visit.  Keep appointment with cardiologist. 

(2)  Chest wall tenderness status post CABG: Tried to encourage patient that there
     will be some persistent discomfort in her wound for several months.  Told her
     to hold off on using the OTC pain patch until I can verify the ingredients. 

(3)  Depressed mood status post surgery: Refuses referral to Mental Health. Not
     suicidal. Encouraged patient to eat more regularly. 

(4)  Return to clinic for follow-up in two weeks.  

This visit lasted for 35 minutes, half of which was spent trying to counsel the patient
to obtain proper nutrition and to go to Mental Health.  I was unsuccessful in
convincing her to attend a Mental Health session.
