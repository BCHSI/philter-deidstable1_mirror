 Record date **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHIDate** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Shelby Dental Care Center **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** **PHI** would like to give you followup on our mutual patient **PHI** **PHI** . As you know , I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia . We performed a catheterization on **PHIDate** . We utilized the right radial artery for access . We found that she developed a significant in stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug eluting stent . This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms . We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug eluting stent . The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure . The final angiographic result was excellent . The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day . She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure , though I will likely favor indefinite therapy . I plan on seeing her again on **PHIDate** in followup . If you have any further questions regarding her care , please do not hesitate to contact me . Sincerely , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , MD eScription document **PHI** IFFocus DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
