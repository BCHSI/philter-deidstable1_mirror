 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Worthington - Internal Medicine **PHI** **PHI** Street , IM **PHI** Citrus **PHI** , MT **PHI** Re : **PHI** Urban **PHI** # **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** : I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. **PHI** Urban in Cardiology Clinic today . As you know , Mr. Urban is a very pleasant **PHI** gentleman who on July **PHI** , **PHI** , while sitting at a concert in Central **PHI** had the sudden onset of feeling unwell , epigastric discomfort , and profound diaphoresis . He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time . By the time he **PHI** , his symptoms had **PHI** . He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers , and was admitted to the medicine service to **PHI** a myocardial infarction . That evening , he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia , which appears to be ventricular tachycardia . He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management . The next morning , he underwent cardiac ultrasound , which revealed an ejection fraction of **PHI** % and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall . Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive . He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system . This artery was stented with total of three stents ( two Express stents **PHI** x **PHI** mm and one **PHI** stent **PHI** x **PHI** mm ), **PHI** the entire length of the right coronary artery . A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of **PHI** % with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall . He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of **PHI** and a peak troponin of **PHI** . A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July **PHI** , **PHI** . This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to **PHI** %; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic . His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease . Because of this , a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies , normal thyroid function , and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern . He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient . Since his myocardial infarction , Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well . He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager . He has had no symptoms of angina , dyspnea , nausea , or diaphoresis . He has felt very well . He continues to take his medications without difficulty , and denies any symptomatology whatsoever . His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care . Of note , he reports to me that about **PHI** or **PHI** years ago while living in Georgia , he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort . He was **PHI** and released . He never had any further testing . He did not have a stress test , cardiac ultrasound or catheterization . Prior to his admission , he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia , but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital . His medications include aspirin **PHI** mg daily , Plavix **PHI** mg daily , Lipitor **PHI** mg daily , lisinopril **PHI** mg daily , and carvedilol **PHI** mg twice each day . He has no known drug allergies . Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for **PHI** , Inc , he moved to Georgia where he lived for **PHI** years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions . He **PHI** to America about a year or so ago . He has been working in Borders . He currently lives in Toledo , Montana , with his wife . He has no children . He smoked **PHI** to **PHI** packs per day for about **PHI** years , but has not smoked since his hospitalization . He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use . He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had **PHI** myocardial infarctions and died at a **PHI** age of heart disease . On physical exam , his blood pressure was **PHI** mmHg in his right arm and **PHI** mmHg in his left arm . His heart rate is **PHI** and regular . In general , he is in no apparent distress . His jugular venous pressure is **PHI** cm of water . His chest is clear to auscultation without rales , wheezes , or rhonchi . His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2 . He has no murmurs , rubs , or **PHI** . His abdomen is benign . His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without **PHI** . His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without **PHI** . His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization . The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a **PHI** pulse . His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout . His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of **PHI** mg/dl , LDL of **PHI** mg/dl , and HDL of **PHI** . His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm . He has T wave **PHI** in III and aVF , and he has a greater than **PHI** degree disparity between his R and T wave axis . Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday . He **PHI** for **PHI** minutes **PHI** seconds achieving a maximum workload of **PHI** METS , and a peak double product of **PHI** . His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia . His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which **PHI** after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction . There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere . His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at **PHI** %. In **PHI** , Mr. Urban is a **PHI** who had an inferior myocardial infarction , but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease . Also , his systolic function has improved over time . I think there are two processes going on . One is coronary artery disease . Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery , which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting . The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease . Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction , I can only speculate as to the etiology of this . He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy , but a transient one . I suspect that this is myocarditis . **PHI** , I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit . It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome . From the aspect of his coronary artery disease , he will continue on aspirin for life . He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery , and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least **PHI** months . For his hyperlipidemia , I agree with Lipitor , and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate . His LDL goal will be less than **PHI** . He is well **PHI** on his carvedilol , and we will continue with the current dose of **PHI** mg twice daily . His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from **PHI** to **PHI** mg daily . I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup . I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months ' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out . Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman . The patient was seen and examined , and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville **PHI** .
