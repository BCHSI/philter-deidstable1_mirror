 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** I saw this patient with Dr. Rosalia West . I confirm that I have **PHI** and examined the patient , reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient 's chart , and discussed the evaluation , plan of care , and disposition with the patient . Please see the resident 's note for further details . CHIEF COMPLAINT : Altered mental status . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a **PHI** female with history of prior **PHI** , hypertension , diabetes , and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , who presents with altered mental status . As per report , the patient has not been acting like herself and not communicating or speaking like herself . The patient was in her usual state of health until a few days ago where she started to develop a cough as well as some chills . The patient 's family members state that the patient has not been out of bed and has been unwilling to eat . The patient 's family members state that the patient is not acting like her usual self . The patient 's family members deny **PHI** the patient complaining of any nausea , vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath . The patient was actually taken to clinic yesterday because the patient was starting to speak less . The patient was seen clinic and was thought to be depressed . The patient has a known history of a facial droop . The patient was incontinent of urine today . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : The patient 's vital signs reveal the following : Temperature was **PHI** , heart rate **PHI** beats per minute , respiratory rate **PHI** , blood pressure is **PHI** , and oxygen saturation was **PHI** % on room air . The patient 's oxygen saturation was **PHI** as borderline low . General : No acute distress , multiple family members at bedside . HEENT : The patient 's head was normocephalic and atraumatic , no scalp hematomas . Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light . Mucous membranes were somewhat dry , right facial droop noted , no drooling . Neck : Supple , no JVD , no carotid **PHI** appreciated . There was no meningismus . Respiratory : Poor cooperation with exam . Fair aeration , no focal rhonchi , rales , or wheezes , no increased work of breathing or use of accessory muscles was noted . Cardiovascular : Irregularly irregular , tachycardic , unable to appreciate any **PHI** murmurs , rubs , or **PHI** . GI : Abdomen : Soft , no rebound or guarding , prior **PHI** prior **PHI** scar noted . Rectal exam deferred . GU exam : The patient was incontinent of urine . Skin : Warm and dry . No rash or lesions were noted . Back : The patient did not have any costovertebral angle tenderness . There is no midline thoracic , lumbar , or sacral spine tenderness to palpation . Extremities : Warm and well perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis or asymmetrical lower extremity edema was noted . There were no palpable cords . Neuro : The patient was alert , the patient was a verbal . The patient grossly moved all **PHI** extremities with fair strength . The patient **PHI** to touch appropriately . The patient was unable to cooperate with cranial nerve examination . INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN : The patient is a **PHI** female with history of prior stroke , hypertension , diabetes , and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , who presents with altered mental status and urinary incontinence . Differential diagnosis at this time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality . The patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and as per review of prior notes . Repeat stroke is certainly on the differential , however , I have a lower suspicion then for a metabolic or infectious etiology . The patient will need to have a large workup including laboratory studies , urine studies , Foley catheter , portable chest x-ray , and repeat noncontrast head CT scan . EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE : Upon arrival to the Emergency Department , the patient had history and physical exam performed . The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response . The patient 's **PHI** EKG revealed a rate of **PHI** beats per minute , atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , stable **PHI** **PHI** noted over the lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads . No definite ST segment abnormalities were noted . The patient then had a portable chest x-ray and as per report , the patient 's portable chest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or findings . The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and the patient 's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some right-sided edema . The patient will have this followed up with an MRI of the brain . The patient 's laboratory studies were notable for sodium of **PHI** and potassium of **PHI** . The patient's lactic acid was **PHI** . The patient 's white blood cell count was not elevated . The patient was not anemic . The patient's urinalysis was consistent with infection . The patient 's first set of cardiac markers were negative . The patient 's coagulation studies were normal . The patient was treated with ceftriaxone for her urinary tract infection . The patient could possibly have urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia . Urine sepsis is my leading diagnosis at this time . The patient 's right-sided edema is certainly concerning , however , I do not feel that the patient will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time . The patient will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis . The patient will need to be admitted to a monitor bed . The patient 's blood pressure is normal , and as such , I do not feel that the patient needs an intensive care unit bed . In terms the patient 's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , the patient was given metoprolol IV . The patient was not given any oral medications secondary to her possible stroke . The patient was given rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her elevated potassium at **PHI** . PRIMARY DIAGNOSES : **PHI** . Urosepsis . **PHI** . Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response . **PHI** . Hyponatremia . **PHI** . Hyperkalemia . DISPOSITION : The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a monitor bed . CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION : Stable , but guarded . **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** M.D .
