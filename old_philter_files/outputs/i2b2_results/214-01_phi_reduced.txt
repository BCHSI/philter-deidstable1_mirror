He left **PHI** City after I saw him in **PHI** when he was free of angina . While taking an afternoon walk in **PHI** during early **PHI** he experienced fairly severe mid sternal pain without diaphoresis ; pain radiated to the left upper arm and patient **PHI** it as `` sharp burning pressure ''. He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes . There days later pain reccurred , again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED . An EKG was `` normal '' and he was discharged on NG . Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones , he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized . On **PHI** **PHI** he was catheterized and found to have `` diffuse CAD '' involving several vessels . Stent placement was not attempted . His LV EF was 55 % and he was transferred to a medical **PHI** . A day later , on **PHI** **PHI** , he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP ; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on **PHI** **PHI** on the following medication ASA 81 mg Plavix 75 mg po qd Bisoprolol 5mg po qd Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am **PHIDate** po in pm Ranitidine 300 mg po qd Lipitor 40 mg po qd A sleeping medication 3 mg ? Lexotan one po hs Metformin 1000 mg po bid Mr. **PHI** has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital . He then experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes . It is worth noting that ETT here in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was was read as not suggestive of ischemia Testing performed STRESS ECHO , DOPPLER , COLOR DOPPLER M Mode 2D Quality Conclusion 1 . Patient exercised 6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol , reaching stage 3 , and stopped secondary to fatigue . No chest pain was reported . Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm ( 84 % of maximum HR predicted for age ), and BP at peak exercise was 154 68 . The maximum rate pressure product was 18,942.2 . See exercise report for full ECG details . Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm . There were 1 mm horizontal upsloping ST depressions in leads V3 6 and lead II at peak **PHI** . Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals Normal left ventricular size and systolic function . Estimated resting ejection fraction is 60 %. No resting segmental wall motion abnormalities . Trace mitral **PHI** . Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise reveal Normal increase in overall systolic function , with an estimated ejection fraction of & gt ; 80 %. All segments augment normally , without inducible wall motion abnormalities.SUMMARY No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia , atslightly less than target heart rate ( which decreases the sensitivity of **PHI** ) .ATTENDING STAFF **PHI** , **PHI** V., M.D., PH.D . Mr. **PHI** has Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis ( now fully resolved ) who was last seen in **PHI** . At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina . Glycemic control ahs been variable . Last **PHI** in **PHIDate** was 7.8 . Lately there has been an increase in fating levels . Today BG 162 . Last week 112 at home . He is no longer exercising . Has **PHI** X2 but without dysuria . Denies polyuria , polydipsia , nause , chills and fever . Appetite normal . He has residual right shoulder pain after a fall in **PHI** **PHI** which was significantly improved by steroid injections . Episode of bilateral low pitched ringing in his ears has abated . Uses two pillows . No PND , orthopnea and leg edema . Denies vision changes . . Denies episodes of light headedness or vertigo . PMHx H O diabetes mellitus type 2 h o poorly controlled diabetes , which improved and then deteriorated . Cataracts . He was seen by Ophthalmology and was told insurance does not cover cataract surgery which he needs .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN A 78 year old gentleman with a history of adult onset diabetes and CVA who has new onset of exertional angina who was catheterized in **PHI** 2 weeks ago . Findings **PHI** , severe multi vessel disease **PHI** well preserved LVF . LAD Critical stenosis 95 % at origen and bad distal bed LCX obstructed disttally Good marginal obtuse branch with 90 % stenosis med proximal RCA Normal origen **PHI** disease 75 80 % stenosis . Plan Consult Cardiology ASAP meanwhile check BP , Lipids , CBC , TSH , MA and alt ast . Nitroglycerine prescription renewed . Continue present regimen . Patient instructed to call and come to ED if he experiences CP . However he lives in **PHI** and driving in can take some time . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
