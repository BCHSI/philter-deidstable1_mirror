			Assessment and plan:

   Overall, Mr. Urban is doing very well. He continues to be very active with no symptoms of angina or congestive heart failure. Currently, his lipids are under excellent control as is his blood pressure. Ongoing secondary prevention and risk factor modification will continue to be paramount in Mr. Urban's care. I have discussed these issues with him in detail. 



I would like to obtain another echocardiogram to re-assess his ejection fraction which has been low in the past.  Also, I would like to see if he has had further development of pulmonary hypertension.  He will continue his current medications and return to see me in six months' time or sooner if need be.
