AMERICAN LEGION HOSPITAL 
 
NEUROCRITICAL RESIDENT ADMIT NOTE

Name: Ollivo, Kimberly

MRN: 3299811

Date: 6/29/97

Time of Exam: 5:20 p.m.

NICU day: 1




Critically ill secondary to: 
R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration

Critical Care Min: 35 min




History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness. BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived. Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.  Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm 
and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.  She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.  CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.  She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management. 



At baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.  She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.  



PMHx: DM, HTN, dementia, h/o sz d/o not on AED now, Pituitary adenoma, s/p hypophysectomy, hypothyroidism, COPD, dyslipidemia, obesity, fatty liver, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, anxiety, meningitis, Rt humerus fx/osteo/nonunion, Cirrhosis or unclear etiology with hyperammonemia, Neuropathy with paresthesias, presumably due to diabetes



Home meds: Mirtazapine 15 mg daily, Namenda 10 mg daily, Potassium supplementation 20 meq daily, Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, Metoprolol (unclear if metoprolol succinate or tartrate) 25 mg daily, Prednisone 2.5 mg daily, MVI



All: Morphine ( Unknown ) Codeine ( Unknown ) ACE Inhibitor ( Unknown ) LISINOPRIL (cough ) CIPROFLOXACIN HCL (dec effects of sz med ) ATORVASTATIN (abnormal LFT )



SH: Lives with her son in Ardmore. Has two sons and a daughter. Daughter, Yolanda, is the HCP (817-638-1328) and primary caregiver.  She quit smoking 16 years ago.

Physical Exam 

Cardio: S1, S2, reg

Pulm: CTAB

Abd: soft, hypoactive bowel sounds

Skin:  erthematous lesions with centers of white rash in skin folds: neck, under breasts

Ortho: R. arm fracture (old)



Neuro Exam: Off sedation &#8211; no verbal response to noxious stimuli, intermittently extensor postures; minimally reactive small pupils, midline gaze in primary position, able to x-midline, no BTT, + R. corneal brisk vs. L., grimace to nasal tickle better on the L. than on the R., R. UE slight w/d to deep noxious stim, plegic in LUE., w/d briskly in the L. LE vs. RLE, toes up b/l




Imaging/Studies/TCD: 

Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.  CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.





Assessment: 
Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift. The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly. A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI. Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities. 




Plan:

Neuro: ICH with IVH, prior h/o sz d/o not AEDs now

-Serial neuro exams

-no need for AEDs unless declares self with new sz (has been stably off AEDs for prior h/o Sz d/o)

-MRI to r/o underlying mass lesion when able

-N. Surg c/s appreciated for EVD placement




Pulm: 

-intubated
