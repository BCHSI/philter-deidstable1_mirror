(449) 515-0294



REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

1.  The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in

today having just had a stress test.  Stress test showed that she

was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds

achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,

stopped for fatigue.  Immediately after exercise, she did have

some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery. 

There were no EKG changes.  The patient reports that she has been

walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise

level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had

precipitated the hospitalization initially.  She is looking into

cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this. 

She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen. 

She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a

healthy lifestyle.  She has returned to work.  She has follow up

scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.

2.  Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her

Glucophage 2000 mg a day.  She monitors blood sugars but only in

the morning.  Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.

 However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically

sweating and abdominal discomfort.  She has never actually

checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to

occur at work.  She has not had any fainting or dizziness.

3.  Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.

4.  Hypertension.  At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose

because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and

currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.,

atenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d.,

Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d.,

Pravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage

500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric-coated aspirin.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness

of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in

good spirits.  Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is

70 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sclerae are anicteric. 

Neck is supple.  No neck vein distention.  Chest is clear to

percussion and auscultation.  Heart: Regular rhythm.  S1 and S2. 

No murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop.  Extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty

with stenting.  Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer. 

At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac

rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.

2.  Diabetes, seems as though her control is 

impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.  We will

discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.

3.  Elevated cholesterol.  We will check on lipid status in four

weeks' time.  On current medications with target of LDL less than

100.

4.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure acceptable on current medical

regimen.
