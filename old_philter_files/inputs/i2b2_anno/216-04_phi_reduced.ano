 Record date **PHI** Internal Medicine Admission Note PATIENT **PHI** MRN **PHI** ADMIT DATE **PHI** ATTENDING **PHI** PCP Dr. **PHI** (MEDIQUIK) **PHI** CONTACT Daughter **PHI** **PHI** Code status Full Source CC Syncope HPI Ms. **PHI** is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission. Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. **PHI**, Ms. **PHI** has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099. She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures. She was started on Depakote for this. Between **PHI** and **PHI** her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures. EEG in **PHI** showed no evidence of epileptiform activity. In **PHI** she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope. Dr. **PHI** witnessed one of these events in his office in **PHI** and it was associated with hypotension. Ms. **PHI** s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5 8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive. When she wakes up, she is confused and sleepy for 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting. These episodes are associated with jaw clenching, but no tonic clonic movements. Ms. **PHI** does state that she feels dizzy and lightheaded before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy. She does not recall the events herself. The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this). The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene it was normal. In the emergency department, Ms. **PHI** s was afebrile, 82 158 70 18 95% on 2L. She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management. The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position. Do not occur when bearing down, or when she is exerting herself. The episodes are not sudden she appears to have some warning before one occurs. She denies fevers chills. No chest pain, palpitations. Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged. Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus. She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1. Hypertension 2. History of supraventricular tachycardia 3.

Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from **PHI**, this appears unchanged. CXR **PHI** NAD Chest CT **PHI** IMPRESSION Appearance of chest may be at baseline following right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung apex. Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of tiny lung nodules seen. MRI **PHI** Findings Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute ischemia. There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr hole or craniotomy. There are chronic appearing, small right cerebellar infarcts. There are scattered periventricular FLAIR and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent with small vessel ischemic change. There is FLAIR hyperintensity in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral parietal and left occipital lobes. No abnormal enhancement is seen. The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise unremarkable. The major intracranial flow voids are normal. There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. There is partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells. There are bilateral lens implants. The bones, soft tissues and orbits are otherwise unremarkable. MRA There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right posterior cerbral artery. There is diffuse irregularity of the proximal left posterior cerebral artery. There is moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery. The distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized. There is otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of the circle of Willis. Impression Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior predominance as described. This could represent hemorrhage, high protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium injection. Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent with severe stenosis with clot not excluded. Diffuse irregularity of the left posterior cerebral artery. These findings could be secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but vasculitis is another possibility. Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery. No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified. Chronic right cerebellar infarction. Small vessel ischemic changes. Carotid US **PHI** IMPRESSIONS 1. RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS. 2. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION. 3. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION. 4. BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW. Echo 01 1. Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right ventricular and left ventricular systolic function. Left ventricular ejection fraction is in the range of 60%. There is no flattening of the interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure. There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E A ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation. 2. There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root. There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may represent atherosclerotic change. 3. The aortic valve is trileaflet. Cannot fully exclude the possibility of some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent atherosclerotic change of the aorta. There is no evident aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency. Very mild mitral annular fibrosis. Otherwise, the mitral valve appears structurally normal. Normal appearing tricuspid and pulmonary leaflets. There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation. Flow velocity could not be optimally assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. 4. There is no evident pericardial effusion. ASSESSMENT & PLAN 1) Syncope Unclear etiology. History from family sounds much more like seizure. Episode in neurologist s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope. Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome. Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion. Continue MI rule out Repeat echo Continue telemetry EEG F u TSH F U UA Ucx F U guiac F U neuro recs 2) Hx of clot continue coumadin 3) DM continue outpatient regimen, but hold for procedures 4) HTN continue outpatient regimen, but hold for low BP 5) Hypothyroid continue synthroid 6) Hx TIA continue plavix **PHI**, M.D., Pager # **PHI**
