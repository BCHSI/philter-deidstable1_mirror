FINDINGS



Ankle-brachial indices, segmental systolic pressures, and pulse volume

recordings are obtained at rest.



RIGHT:  ABI is .62.  Waveforms and pressures demonstrate SFA, popliteal,

and/or tibial vessel disease.  Perfusion is poor to the digit level.



LEFT:  ABI is .37.  Waveforms and pressures demonstrate iliac, SFA, popliteal,

and/or tibial vessel disease.  Perfusion is poor to the ankle, TM, and digit

levels.



Of note, multiple attempts were made to obtain toe pressures, however, this

proved to be technically impossible due to patient's constant twitching.



IMPRESSIONS:

1. RIGHT SFA, POPLITEAL AND/OR TIBIAL VESSEL DISEASE, WITH MODERATE ABI

REDUCTION, AND POOR DIGITAL PERFUSION

2. LEFT ILIAC, SFA, POPLITEAL AND/OR TIBIAL VESSEL DISEASE, WITH SEVERE ABI

REDUCTION, AND POOR PERFUSION TO THE ANKLE, TM, AND TOE LEVELS

3. TECHNICALLY UNABLE TO OBTAIN TOE PRESSURES





A/P:  This is a 85yo male s/p AVR, CABG with chronic pressure ulcerations at his soles bilaterally secondary to proximal disease. Recommend foot elevation when at rest, heel protection, specially-fitted shoes. 

Will D/W Dr. Quiring  for endovascular intervention.
