HPI:   	Mr Xayavong is a 56yoM with cardiac risk factors of DM, tobacco, HTN who presents from OSH with chest pain beginning at 10:30 the morning of admission.  He says he doesn't remember what he was doing at the time, but was not engaged in strenuous activity.  Describes diaphoresis , then 7/10 pain from left shoulder into left arm and chest.

Urinalysis:

Pending



CXR:	pending



EKG:	NSR @ 79, 1mm STE V2-V4, Qs V1-3



Prelim echo: Anteroseptal and lateral hypokinesis, EF 30-40%, no significant valvular lesions.

___________________________________________



Impression:  56yoM with anterior STEMI, s/p half-dose lytics, s/p cath showing thrombotic prox LAD not intervened on.  Now on IABP, chest-pain free.



Plan: 



1.     Ischemia

  	Will likely go back for repeat cath on Monday, possible LAD intervention

  	IABP 1:1 for now, with ancef prophylaxis

  	Keep on integrilin, heparin with close PTT monitoring

  	ASA

  	Holding on BB given decreased EF, some sinus pauses

  	Holding on statin for now, given transaminitis

  	Trending markers



2.     Rhythm

  	D/c lidocaine, holding BB

  	Transcutaneous pacing pads



3.     Pump

  	EF 30-40%, will likely re-echo later

  	Appears euvolemic



4.     DM

  	Holding oral hypoglycemics

  	RISS



5.     Prophylaxis

  	Heparin, Nexium



6.     Dispo

  	Full Code
