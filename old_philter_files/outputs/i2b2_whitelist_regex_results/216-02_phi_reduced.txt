 Record date **PHI** **PHI** Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note PATIENT **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** MRN **PHI** ADMIT DATE **PHIDate** PCP unknown CC tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital HPI **PHI** with multiple medical problems including breast ca s p R. breast lumpectomy , chemotherapy and radiation treatment **PHI** years ago , recurrent syncope , and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist s office on **PHIDate** . At that time , she c o dizziness , nausea , and her bp reportedly decreased to **PHI** **PHI** . As per pt s family , she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused , dizzy , and **PHI** and was brought to Rafael Mount ED . Five **PHI** ago prior to her hospital admission pt s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and **PHI** stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration . Upon return from vacation , and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time , c o increasing weakness , backpain , and fevers . During the same time , the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams . At present , pt . c o severe ( **PHIDate** ) upper back pain and mid sternal CP ( **PHIDate** ) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement . She reports that she is **PHI** of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous . Hospital Course MRSA Bacteremia Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt . was started on IV vancomycin . The **PHI** source remains unclear . TTE on **PHIDate** showed an EF of **PHI** **PHI** %, no evidence of endocarditis reported . A TEE on **PHIDate** **PHI** all the valves and no vegetations were seen . Her R. knee was **PHI** on **PHIDate** and cultures were negative . A bone scan on **PHIDate** showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee . Back pain Pt . c o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at **PHI** . Thoracic spine xrays on **PHIDate** showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation . An MRI of thoracic spin ( **PHIDate** ) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11 . The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease . No epidural extension was noted . There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord . Pt . received dilaudid **PHI** **PHI** mg **PHI** prn back pain . As per psych notes , she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl . **PHI** CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on **PHIDate** and was non diagnostic . A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the **PHI** f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at **PHI** . A repeat MRI was done on **PHIDate** due to increasing c o back pain and showed a **PHI** % compression fx of T4 , **PHI** **PHI** marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11 , and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies . Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r o myeloma . Right Breast Mass A firm R. breast mass was noted at the **PHI** o clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be **PHIDate** to previous sx by **PHI** at OSH . A mammogram on **PHIDate** showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts . The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified . An u s of R. breast showed no discrete mass . A biopsy was delayed **PHIDate** to bacteremia . Renal failure Pt . developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from **PHI** to **PHI** . Her vancomycin level was noted to be > **PHI** on **PHIDate** and vanco was discontinued . Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus . Anemia On admission to Rafael Hospital , Hb Hct **PHI** . **PHI** . She was started on procrit by hematology . She was transfused on unit of **PHI** in the hospital . TIA Pt . has a hx of **PHI** with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling . An MRI that day showed new increased signal w in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely . This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium , though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded . A brain MRI on **PHIDate** showed resolution of **PHI** signal w in the ventricles , decrease in high signal in the subarachnoid space , likely **PHI** resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium . No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w in the L. lope , which may represent vitreal hemorrhage . HTN Pt . required adjustments in her **PHI** during her hospital stay to control hypertension . MEDICAL HISTORY Recurrent syncope **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** events per year , last event prior to hospitalization Seizure disorder first sz in **PHI** with unresponsive , staring , mouth movements ; often occurred in clusters once a year , last sz prior to admission .
