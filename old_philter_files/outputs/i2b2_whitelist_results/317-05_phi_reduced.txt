 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** CHIEF COMPLAINT : Lower extremity cellulitis . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This is a **PHI** diabetic vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity cellulitis , has diagnosed by her PCP . She was recently treated at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis , had a **PHI** hospital stay , and was discharged home on Keflex . She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past **PHI** hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities . She has also been having some emesis , myalgias and fatigue , but has not had any hematemesis , abdominal pain , constipation , diarrhea , or other symptomatology . She has also not **PHI** any urinary symptoms of frequency . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Peripheral vascular disease , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and diabetes . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Amputation to the left second , third and fifth toes , bilateral **PHI** bypasses right in **PHI** , left in **PHI** and anterior tibial bypass graft in **PHI** . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies tobacco , alcohol , or drugs . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Blood pressure **PHI** , pulse **PHI** , respiratory rate **PHI** , temperature **PHI** , and O2 saturation **PHI** % on room air . General : This is a **PHI** woman in no apparent distress . Respiratory : Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no rales , rhonchi , or wheezes . Cardiovascular : Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or **PHI** . GI : The abdomen is soft . The patient does have insulin pump in place , but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump . Skin is warm , dry , and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity , which is erythematous , warm and slightly swollen compared to the right lower extremity . This erythema stops at the ankle and does not extend up above the knee . The patient also has an open chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot as well . There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic : Awake , alert , and oriented x3 except for some decreased sensation in her left foot , which is chronic . EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE : The patient was seen and **PHI** by me and the resident . I confirm that I have seen and **PHI** the patient , reviewed the resident 's documentation on the patient 's chart , and discussed the evaluation , plan of care , and disposition with the patient as well as the resident . The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel . CBC showed white count of **PHI** with shift . LFTs were within normal limits . X-ray of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray of her **PHI** continued to show no osteomyelitis . Given the erythema and swelling , I was concerned about a cellulitis in this vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a **PHI** g of vancomycin ( especially given the fact that she has failed outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics ) and we are admitting her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis . The patient's erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be extremely atypical for a DVT . We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient 's admission to Medicine as she is followed closely by Surgery and this notification was made at **PHI** p.m . Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she does not have any **PHI** abnormalities , I did not believe that she needs **PHI** or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on maintenance fluids , antibiotics , and admitting her to the hospital . DIAGNOSIS : Left lower extremity cellulitis . CONDITION : Stable . DISPOSITION : Admit to hospital . **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** MD D : **PHI** T : **PHI** Dictated By : **PHI** , **PHI** eScription **PHI** BFFocus Not reviewed by Attending Physician
