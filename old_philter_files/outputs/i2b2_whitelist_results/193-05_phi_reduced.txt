Dear **PHI** : I saw your patient , Fay **PHI** , in my office today . Mrs. **PHI** is a **PHI** woman who is feeling significantly improved , but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications . Her history of severe hypertension , without definite secondary causes , only a mild left renal artery stenosis , a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension , with a CTA that **PHI** only modest plaques in her **PHI** major coronary arteries , treated dyslipidemia , type II diabetes , and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy , is detailed above . Ms. **PHI** feels that her life has been brought back to her . She takes her amlodipine , lisinopril , and carvedilol at **PHI** a.m. Thirty minutes later , she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the **PHI** mmHg range to **PHI** mmHg range . She believes that her heart rate is approximately **PHI** beats per minute at those times . After **PHI** hours , she starts to feel improved . At **PHI** p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine , again , she has similar symptoms . When she has the symptoms , she sometimes also **PHI** a discomfort in her low back . She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness . She has not had palpitations . She has not had actual lower extremity swelling , though she feels that after her metformin , her legs can feel heavy . She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits . She has not had musculoskeletal achiness , aside from the low back discomfort described . She has not had any peripheral numbness . The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable . The present medications are ASA **PHI** mg a.m., lisinopril **PHI** mg a.m., amlodipine **PHI** of a **PHI** mg tablet a.m., carvedilol **PHI** mg a.m. and **PHI** mg evening , simvastatin **PHI** mg before bedtime , and metformin **PHI** mg before dinner . On examination , the weight is **PHI** pounds , decreased **PHI** pounds compared to **PHI** . The blood pressure was initially **PHI** mmHg with a heart rate of **PHI** beats per minute , respiratory rate **PHI** , and she was complaining of low back discomfort , and she was very slightly lightheaded . Later , the blood pressure was **PHI** mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several **PHI** . She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort . The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm . She is fully alert . The neck veins are not elevated . The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal . There are no carotid **PHI** though there was a transmitted murmur . The lungs are clear . The PMI is not displaced . There is a **PHI** S1 and a physiologically split S2 , with a soft , **PHI** **PHI** systolic murmur across the aortic valve that **PHI** with Valsalva . The abdomen is benign . There is no renal artery bruit . The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema . There is no tenderness of her skin . The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of **PHI** beats per minute , intervals of **PHI** , **PHI** axis , very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening . Impression : Mrs. **PHI** is feeling **PHI** . The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to **PHI** mmHg , with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries , as well as her head . However , today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of **PHI** mmHg . Though we could be **PHI** to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly , or change the times when she takes the medications , I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels . I think that we should continue her on her present regimen . Gradually , we would expect her symptoms , related to changes in blood pressure , to improve as her vessel elasticity **PHI** . I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic . We are pleased with the present regimen . We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her **PHI** or so dramatic , but the treatment would be precisely as it is now . We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment , naturally , remains unchanged . I think that we want her to continue her metformin , and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily , depending on followup A1c values . Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. **PHI** 's care . I know that you will continue to follow her closely . I told her that I would see her again in nine months .
