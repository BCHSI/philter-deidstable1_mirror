 Record date : **PHI** Internal Medicine B Intern Admission Note PATIENT : **PHI** WILHELM MRN : **PHI** ADMIT DATE : **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** ATTENDING : Dr. **PHI** Xian PCP : Dr. **PHI** Frey ( new ) CONTACT : **PHI** Wilhelm , son **PHI** CODE : Full Source : Patient , family , chart **PHI** : no appetite , acute renal failure HPI : **PHI** yo **PHI** woman with h/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy , newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue , weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on **PHI** . At that time , the patient noted that **PHI** mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth , as well as poor oral intake with associated **PHI** lb weight loss . In early May , she presented to the **PHI** clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes . The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter , and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid , lupus-like syndromes , Castleman 's , and indolent lymphoma . Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of **PHI** with Alb of **PHI** , a mild **PHI** in the **PHI** , LDH of **PHI** , ACE of **PHI** , normal TSH , HCT of **PHI** , ESR of **PHI** , SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase , positive ANA at **PHI** with nuclear pore staining ( highly specific for biliary cirrhosis ), elevated **PHI** at **PHI** , and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at **PHI** and **PHI** , respectively and negative HIV . The patient s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF , lasix at times , and a dose of bisphosphonate , which led to a decrease in Ca to **PHI** . Axillary lymph node biopsy **PHI** revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia , though to be consistent with a reactive process . Oncology was **PHI** , and a lymphoma work-up was **PHI** ; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells , CD4+ and CD8+ T cells , with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population . Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary , mediastinal , and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further **PHI** to diagnostic **PHI** . The patient underwent pulmonary function testing , which showed a reduction in the FEV1 , FVC , and **PHI** ratio ; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal , resistance and specific conductance were normal , and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced . On **PHI** , a bronchoscopy was attempted , but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure , and it was not performed . Thoracic surgery was **PHI** and recommended that the patient be **PHI** in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia . Fungal antibodies were sent , and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization . Since discharge , the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued , and has not felt like eating . She reports significant acid reflux , saying only water goes down and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth . She notes continued weight loss of **PHI** since leaving the hospital , tolerating **PHI** more than **PHI** **PHI** of **PHI** per her family . She further denies N/V , diarrhea , **PHI** or recent infection . Of note , she has been drinking **PHI** , but urinating **PHI** times a day , clear urine with large volumes . She has not had a bowel movement for several days . She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge . In addition , her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization . She used to be very active , working nearly every day and keeping up her household . She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping , **PHI** on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally . She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game . She denies suicidal ideation , saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for . ED COURSE : At the ED , the patient was afebrile , HR **PHI** , BP **PHI** , RR **PHI** , O2 Sat **PHI** %.

Hypercalcemia ( as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid ) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis , with dehydration , anorexia , constipation , and PUD , fatigue and depression . This would thus represent a **PHI** diagnosis for this pt s anorexia and acute renal failure , which is most likely prerenal . Plan : ARF :- f/u Ca + Phos . Expect Ca to be high , Phos to be low .
