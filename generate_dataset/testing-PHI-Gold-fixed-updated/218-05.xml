MR#: 2554172
GI Attending: Navarrete, Pamela
DOA: 12/18/2096


REASON FOR CONSULT: HCT drop, guaiac +


HPI:
89M admitted on 12/18 with hypotension and HCT drop.


The patient was admitted on Dec 13th and seen by Dr. Esposito from GI.  Per her note, he was admitted with "complaints of vomiting up food and constant chest pain for 3-4 days. He reports that he has had some troubles with food for the past few months but can't define precisely what the troubles were. It seems that he intermittently vomited or regurgitated both liquids and solids and had a sensation of something getting stuck in his chest. Over the last 3-4 days everything he ate or drank, including water, would come up. He denies nausea. There is no abdominal pain but he describes a constant pain across his chest at the level of his nipples for the past 3-4 days. His pain is currently controlled. He denies pain on swallowing. He does report some weight loss but is unable to identify how much. He denies any new neurologic deficits or headaches.  A barium swallow was obtained which showed a fixed narrowing in the distal esophagus. He has a hx of gastric and duodenal ulcers on endoscopy from 2092 in the setting of NSAID use. He had a normal colonoscopy in 2087."


During that admission. He underwent upper endoscopy that showed severe esophagitis. Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.  The duodenum was normal. He was discharged on December 15th with HCT 31.3.


The patient now returns with HCT drop to 19 and hypotension. He reports continued difficulty swallowing and some nausea, vomiting. "Everything comes up." He says this has been persistent since his discharge.  He also reports continued black stools since discharge as well. No clear BRBPR. His wife notes one episode of hematemesis yesterday.  No lightheadedness, dizziness, DOE, SOB.  In the ED, hypotensive to 60's / 70's SBP, HCT 19, his ABD CT was negative. INR  pending. He was started on pressors (levophed and vasopressin) and transferred to the MICU for ongoing care.


Currently the patient has no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or BRBPR.

STUDIES:
Dec 13th EGD
Impression: - LA Grade D esophagitis. It could represent 
reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagitis or 
underlying malignancy. Biopsied.
- Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.
- Normal examined duodenum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
89M with PMH gastric ulcers and severe esophagitis who returns with HCT drop.  In the setting of guaiac positive stool, he may have bleeding from his gastric ulcers or from the severe esophagitis that was seen endoscopically last week.  He may have a visible vessel at the ulcer site.  Alternatively, he may have a Mallory-Weiss Tear from the wretching due to persistent nausea and vomiting.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:


1. Please make Patient NPO
2. Please ensure two large bore IV's are in place
3. Active Type and Cross
4. HCT checks TID
5. IV PPI
6. Plan EGD today once resuscitated7.
7. Please check INR and reverse if needed. With an elevated lactate, he may be septic.
