Ms. **PHI** is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1 66 ; she was required sub occipital craniotomy , clot evacuation , and placement for a VP shunt . She was transferred to **PHI** County Clinic **PHIDate** , and was d c 'd **PHIDate** . Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication . She gets nutrition and medication through a G tube at this point , and has had an indwelling foley catheter . Computer notes suggest that prior to **PHI** **PHI** , the indwelling foley catheter had been removed . However , the patient 's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry , the notes suggest that the foley was replaced **PHIDate** . **PHIDate** Ms. **PHI** was taken to the emergency room ; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear . U A was suggestive of a UTI , and she was treated with a 3 day course of levofloxacin . There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time , and urine cultures were not sent . Telephone notes from **PHIDate** suggest that Ms. **PHI** had yeast infection and foley blockage ; **PHIDate** the VNA checked a U A at home ; results were consistent with a UTI . Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and less herself over the last few days . She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation . In the ED , repeat U A was consistent with UTI ; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus . She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor .

No significant change compared to prior CT Brain **PHIDate** . No change in ventricle size . No acute infarct ; although , this is better assessed with MR with diffusion . 2 . Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup . EKG Normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , normal intervals . Flattened T waves , but not changed from prior exam . No evidence of acute ischemia . Impression 70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function , admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status . Mental status changes given likely undertreated UTI **PHIDate** , pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source . Important to rule out VP shunt complication as cause of mental status **PHI** , but CT appears unchanged from **PHIDate** . Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat to mental status changes . will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes , particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism UTI likely UTI tx will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen , but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back , then treat with appropriate antibiotic treat with **PHI** for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data change foley now resend u a and culture after 1 2 days of antibiotics Hyponatremia may be contributing to any change in mental status volume status very difficult to assess if hypovolemic , likely hypovolemic hyponatremia . If euvolemic , likely SIADH , which could be caused by neurologic process , pain , or infection given difficulty assessing volume status , will send urine for sodium and osm . If low sodium high osm , likely hypovolemic . If higher sodium , more likely SIADH .
