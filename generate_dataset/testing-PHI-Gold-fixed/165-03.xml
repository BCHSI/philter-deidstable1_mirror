NAME:    Yager, Becky 
MRN:     0887181

Becky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.  A lot has happened since she
was seen.  She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.  She
therefore has been having financial problems.  She does not have enough money to
buy her medications.  She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. 
She has not taken these medications for months.  She states she has been taking her
nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed.  When I called her from
the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before
she fell.  We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was
taken.  She reports being off balance for about the past month.  She has been feeling
more unsteady on her feet.  She states she has not actually fallen but has come close
to falling.  She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in
mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait.  On review of other systems, she
reports a 20 lb. weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not
working and being at home and eating more than usual.  She also notes that she has
begun urinating at night which she previously did not do.  She complains of excessive
dry mouth.  She reports being more thirsty than usual.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self.  She is alert and
oriented X 3.  Speech fluent without aphasia.  BP sitting 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Standing
BP unchanged at 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent
bilateral nystagmus.  Otherwise intact.  On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary
movements.  No drift.  Good power throughout.  Fine finger movements intact. 
Vibratory loss to the ankles.  Babinski flexor bilaterally.  

When she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she
was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.  

IMPRESSION:  Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her
medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed. 
Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth.  Her
exam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus.  Therefore I suspect toxic
metabolic cause.  As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox
screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER.  I will be
in touch with the physicians after they see her.
