CC: Syncope, Afib


HPI: 
71 year old lady with a history of A fib was seen in clinic today for complaints of DOE and increased wt. She was found to be in mild to moderate CHF and an increase in her torsemide dose was recommended. On her way to a blood draw, while in the elevator, she had syncope and hit her head. The fall was witnessed by her daughter. There was no prodrome, no nausea, no incontinence with the fall. The pt does not have any seizure or hypoglycemia history. She notes an 8 lb wt gain over 2-3 weeks and denies dietary indiscretions. She takes her medications faithfully which include an escalating dose of torsemide in over the last several months. She's been hospitalized twice for CHF - once in 2075 and again in 11/77.


The pt was brought to the ED. In the ED the patient had a head CT was done which did not reveal any acute pathology.

#CV - i. Low suspicion ACS- Rule out with serial CE
- Continue asa, statin#CV - p. Decompensated CHF- Diuresis with IV lasix. Consider lasix drip if inadequate response.
- Daily wt. Strict I/O.- Cont. digoxin- Will start amiodarone 400 bid- Discuss possible role of AICD with patient and family.#CV - r. - Telemetry#AFR - acute on chronic - likely from poor forward flow- reduce lisinopril- urine electrolytes, eos.
#Psych
- continue celexa
#Endocrine
- continue home thyroid regimen
#FEN
- low sodium, 2L fluid restricted diet#CODE: Full
