Mr. **PHI** has experienced multiple falls recently , and was ultimately diagnosed with Parkinsons last **PHI** . Following the diagnosis , he was discharged to **PHI** City Hospital , where he continued to experience falls . After one episode , he was forcibly picked up , and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter . He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal . After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain , erythema , and warmth , he was re hospitalized at **PHI** , where he underwent L shoulder aspiration . MRI **PHIDate** demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff , with associated large joint effusion . Of note , he denied fevers , chills , or NS . L shoulder aspiration **PHIDate** demonstrated purulent fluid , with 2,800,000 WBC ( 97 % PMN ). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters . He subsequently underwent L shoulder I & D **PHIDate** , with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid . He was started on cefazolin . Culture results returned a pan sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate ( including to ampicillin , cefazolin , clindamycin , penicillin , rifampin ). Blood cultures were negative . He was taken back to the OR **PHIDate** for arthroscopy , with extensive debridement . **PHI** findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue , with no normal appearing **PHI** present . A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid **PHI** , and a second in the subacromial space . He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks , and then given amoxicillin ( either 1g BID or 500mg TID , unsure which ) x 2 weeks . Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained **PHIDate** , which was reviewed with staff radiologist , and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra infraspinatus teres minor subscapularis biceps tendons , with also persistent large joint effusion , extensive synovitis , and full thickness **PHI** loss of glenoid and humeral head . Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head . Overall , was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease . Mr. **PHI** was seen in the ID clinic **PHIDate** , at which time he complained of a several week h o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity . He did not experience shoulder pain at rest , and had not recently noted erythema . No drainage . Appetite was near baseline , though he had experienced fatigue . Blood glucoses had been well controlled . His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs , which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103 , with stable pulse BP , and overall well controlled blood sugars . Date ESR CRP **PHIDate** 88 23 **PHIDate** 96 28 **PHIDate** 67 9.4 Unfortunately , Mr. **PHI** sustained a mechanical fall **PHIDate** . Following the fall , he had significantly increased hip pain . Hip pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem . Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision . ROS as per HPI . Denied having R hip pain prior to his fall . No cough , sore throat , chest discomfort , abdominal pain , dysuria , diarrhea . Extensive ROS otherwise negative .

Assessment 77 yo M with DMII , CHF ( EF 20 25 %), afib , Parkinson 's , prostate cancer s p XRT c b proctitis and GIB , multiple hip replacements , recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis ( **PHIDate** **PHIDate** ) who presented **PHIDate** s p fall . With regards to his shoulder , it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4 week abx course . Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam , 2 months after completion of his course , it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis . The MRI is difficult to interpret , and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes . He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers ( though confounded by multiple comorbidities ). Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection , our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically , off abx , for signs of recurrent infection . However , given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement , would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder . As such , would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics . The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated , and blood cultures were negative . However , such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding , and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected . This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening . Alternatively , he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls , or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (? read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis ). Recommendations hold antibiotics , including pre operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data Aspirate shoulder . Send fluid for cell counts , Gram stain , aerobic anaerobic fungal cultures if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement would obtain hip biopsies in the OR , again off abx , to assess for possible hip infection likewise , would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement check CK , given elevated Cr following fall , and possible rhabdo Thank you for this interesting consultation .
