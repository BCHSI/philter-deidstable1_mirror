Rectal wall thickening with fecal impaction , consistent with proctitis , possibly due to venous stasis . **PHI** . Thickened urinary bladder wall with irregularity and enhancement consistent with cystitis . **PHI** . Slight increase in moderate ascites since **PHIDate** . **PHI** . Distended urinary bladder with unchanged bladder wall thickening . Also noted are moderate bilateral pleural effusions . CXR IMPRESSION Pulmonary edema with large left effusion small right effusion . TTE MITRAL VALVE There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus . There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse . There is trace mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler . There is a calcified papillary muscle tip . LEFT ATRIUM The left atrium is elongated . The antero posterior left atrial dimension is **PHI** mm ( normal range up to **PHI** mm ). The medial lateral left atrial dimension is **PHI** mm ( normal range up to **PHI** mm ). The superior inferior left atrial dimension is **PHI** mm ( normal range up to **PHI** mm ). AORTIC VALVE , AORTA , LVOT Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis . The aortic valve is tricuspid . There is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler . The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is **PHI** mm ( normal less than 40mm ). The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular junction is **PHI** mm ( normal less than or equal to **PHI** ). LEFT VENTRICLE The left ventricular cavity size is normal .

There are intrapericardial fibrinous strands . There is evidence of a large pleural effusion . There is ascites . **PHI** Compared to the study of **PHIDate** , a small circumferential pericardial effusion is now noted , and the measured RVSP has decreased ( **PHI** mm Hg previously ). LVH and RVH have appeared .
