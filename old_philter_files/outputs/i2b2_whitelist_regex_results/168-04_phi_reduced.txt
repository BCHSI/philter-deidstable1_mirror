NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL FINDINGS . CXR Cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema . The findings are more prominent then the prior study from **PHIDate** x ray . EKG NSR **PHI** with **PHI** in I and TWI in L unchanged from **PHIDate** Impression **PHI** yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity . His current exam is c w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits . The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency , opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy . He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners . Recommendations check UA , NH3 lower systolic blood pressure to below **PHI** , e.g . with Labetalol . Give 2g **PHI** ( given renal **PHI** ), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal . Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity Check MRI A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr **PHI** **PHI** Thank you for this interesting consult . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D Resident in Neurology Pgr **PHI**
