 Record date : **PHI** CARDIOLOGY SAINT VINCENT HOSPITAL Interval History : Since last seen , **PHI** notes that her weight continues to rise , and with this , her angina is clearly worse .

EKG : NSR with an old **PHI** . She also has non specific **PHI** wave abnormalities . When compared to a previous tracing there is no change . Impression : **PHI** , s/p cath and stenting : her angina is clearly related to her weight going up again ; I worry about this , and wonder if she should have another weight loss surgery .
