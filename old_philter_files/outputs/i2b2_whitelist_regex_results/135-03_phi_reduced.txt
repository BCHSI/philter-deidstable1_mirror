In **PHI** , pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate **PHI** her pacer . Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well . will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease , LV function , could consider stress test will consult EP to assess pacer function pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent will re check carotid studies will re start ASA ( it was recently stopped ) given carotid and vascular disease **PHI** .
