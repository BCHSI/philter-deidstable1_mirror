patient is a 54-year-old female seen by Dr. Paulson and also by the 
Oncology service.  Briefly, this is a 54-year-old female with a 
known mass in her vagina, who presents now with vaginal bleeding. 
The patient was seen earlier yesterday by the Oncology service, 
and is scheduled to have surgery for the mass to be removed, but 
she developed significant vaginal bleeding and presented to the 
Emergency Department today.  She is otherwise healthy.  Her first 
time seen in the Emergency Department or seen by Oncology was two 
weeks ago for increased bleeding.  She was diagnosed at the time 
with a necrotic fibroid, and was confirmed by studies to have a 
large fibroid at that time.  She now presents with increasing 
weakness and light-headedness and more bleeding. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department, an IV 
was started, and laboratory studies sent, including CBC, 
electrolytes, PT/PTT, and she was also typed and crossed and a 
urinalysis sent.  A chest x-ray and EKG were sent.  The patient was 
made n.p.o.  She is a preoperative patient.  Her initial hematocrit 
here was 23.  A full note was written by the Oncology service, 
and she is currently admitted to that service. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Vaginal bleeding with necrotic leiomyoma. 
DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  As above.  The 
patient's condition on admission is stable.
