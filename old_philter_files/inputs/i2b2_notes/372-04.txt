RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES


CT brain w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass-effect, midline shift or acute territorial infarction. Chronic healed naso-orbito-ethmoid fracture.

CXR - Progression of predominantly bibasilar nodular and interstitial opacities, possibly be due to chronic aspiration. Recommend CT.



EKG

Nsr 94 bpm, LAD, no Q waves, no ST-T changes

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

78 yo M with DM, HTN, ulcers, indwelling SPC who presents with one week of feeling &#8220;lousy&#8221; and a maximum temperature of 104 degrees F.  Exam was remarkable for LLE erythema consistent with cellulitis.  Labs were notable for a high WBC with a neutrophilic predominance and a clean urinalysis.  Given his history of fever, exam, and lab studies, infection is the most likely cause of Mr. Flaherty&#8217;s current presentation.  



ISSUE #1: Fever and leukocytosis


Most likely secondary to cellulitis vs wound infection

Blood cultures, urine cultures, wound cultures, and respiratory cultures

Panculture if SPIKES

f/u microbiology c and s

start broad spectrum antibiotics: Vancomycin 1 g q12 IV for presumed MRSA and Unasyn 3000 mg IV q6 for presumed gram negatives (with minimal anaerobe coverage)

if clinically decompensates, will consider Zosyn for pseudomonal coverage and Flagyl for anaerobe coverage



ISSUE #2: Diabetes Mellitus


continue with home regimen of metformin 1000 bid and lantus 14 SC

insulin sliding scale for coverage

FSBG AC+HS

Last A1C 8.4 8/1/26



ISSUE #3: HTN


Continue with home regimen of lisinopril 40 mg daily, atenolol 50 mg daily

Monitor and titrate as needed



ISSUE #4: Home safety and cleanliness


Will ask for assistance from social work and case management re: potential need of home safety evaluation

Assess for competency &#8211; re: safety at home



FEN: diabetic diet, replete lytes prn, will bolus 1000 cc NS



PROPHYLAXIS

GI: omeprazole

DVT: Fragmin

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn



CODE:  unknown
