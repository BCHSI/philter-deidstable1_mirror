 Record date **PHI** CARDIOLOGY OAKLAND ASSOCIATES CENTER Interval History This 63 y o male patient with a h o HTN , HLP , non revascularized 4 vessel CAD , preserved LV systolic function , PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA , tobacco abuse , type 2 DM , peripheral neuropathy , L ulnar nerve compression , ulcerative colitis , GERD , depressive disorder , anxiety disorder , and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure . The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow up by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** at the OAC **PHIDate** , at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms , RLE > LLE , with pain in his buttocks , thighs , and calves with ambulation . He reports that these symptoms , coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms , have become quite **PHI** and lifestyle limiting . The patient denies any chronic or poorly healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities . Given his history and symptomatic complaints , Dr. **PHI** recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re assess his PAD and , if indicated and feasible , to pursue percutaneous revascularization . The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on **PHIDate** , performed by Dr. **PHI** , which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA , the former with a balloon expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self expanding biliary stent . Follow up lower extremity non invasive studies performed at the OAC in **PHIDate** revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE , which dropped to 0.24 following exercise ( as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post exercise ). The patient has not been treated with **PHI** in the past . An important side note is the fact that the patient 's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in **PHIDate** revealed significant 4 vessel CAD , which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously . The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re assessed by angiography during today 's peripheral catheterization procedure , not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future . Past medical history 1 . Hypertension ( managed with chronic beta blocker and ACE inhibitor medications ). 2 . Hyperlipidemia ( managed with a chronic `` statin '' medication ). 3 .

Duplex U S also revealed revealed significantly elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal**PHI** **PHI**  ( PSV 306 cm sec ), as well as moderately elevated velocities in the proximal to mid L SFA ( PSV 191 cm sec ). Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs . Assessment and plan ASSESSMENT 63 y o male patient with a h o HTN , HLP , non revascularized 4 vessel CAD , preserved LV systolic function , PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA , tobacco abuse , type 2 DM , peripheral neuropathy , L ulnar nerve compression , ulcerative colitis , GERD , depressive disorder , anxiety disorder , and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms ( RLE > LLE ). In addition , a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well , particularly because of the patient 's known unrevascularized multi vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression . The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest , hemodynamically stable , in sinus rhythm , well oxygenated on room air , in no distress , and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today . PLAN 1 . Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning , which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+ possible percutaneous revascularization ). 2 . Informed written consent obtained from the patient ( by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow ) pre procedure this morning . 3 . No pre medication for renal and or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography . 4 . Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. **PHI** post procedure . 5 . Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA , Plavix , Toprol XL , Lisinopril , and Zocor . 6 . Continue holding the patient 's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today . 7 . Monitor the patient 's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia . 8 . Continue the patient on Glipizide , a PPI ( Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [ formulary limitations ]), Neurontin , **PHI** , Chantix , Hytrin , and Vitamin B12 . 9 . Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following CBC , Chem 7 , Mg , **PHI** , HS CRP , Lipoprotein ( a ), and Homocysteine . 10 . Discharge timing will depend upon today 's procedural findings and events , the patient 's peri and post catheterization course , and the potential need for further monitoring , testing , or treatment in the inpatient setting . 11 . Following his hospital discharge , the patient should see Dr. **PHI** in outpatient vascular medicine follow up in approximately 4 6 weeks , with follow up lower extremity non invasive studies ( particularly resting and post exercise ABIs ) at that time . 12 . Will re address with Dr. **PHI** the need to consider the patient 's need for coronary arterial revascularization , either percutaneously or surgically , given the severity and multi vessel involvement . 13 .
