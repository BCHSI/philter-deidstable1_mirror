                     RGH EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

MULLINS,DOLORES U   728-41-92-0               VISIT DATE: 01/24/73

This patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well 

as Dr. Hawkins whose note I reviewed and with which I agree.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 70-year-old female who 

presents with inability to control her left arm and left leg.  The 

patient had onset of her symptoms approximately two hours prior to 

arrival.  The patient denies any change in sensation but she 

definitely did notice weakness with decreased ability to control 

her left side extremities.  The patient states that her left arm 

control was regained after approximately one or two hours.  Her 

left leg control is better but still is not back to baseline.  

Review of systems, family history and social history as per the 

resident's note.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 

hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Diltiazem, labetalol.

ALLERGIES:  TETANUS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

female, in mild distress, appears concerned.  Temperature is 96.9 

degrees, pulse 65, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 

163/104.  Repeat blood pressure is 174/80.  Oxygen saturation is 

97% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 

equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 

motions are intact.  No nystagmus.  NECK:  Supple with full range 

of motion.  2+ carotids, no bruits.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and 

rhythm.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Extremities 

are nontender to palpation throughout.  NEURO:  Alert, oriented x 

3.  Follows commands, appropriate.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  There is 5/5 motor strength in individual motor group 

testing of the upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. 

The patient is unable to stand without assistance.  Comprehension 

is within normal limits.  Further details of the physical 

examination are as per the resident's note.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 162, 

BUN of 20, creatinine 1.3, sodium 145, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, 

bicarb 26, calcium 9.4.  White count is 8.1, hematocrit 39.0, 

platelets 341.  A UA shows no blood, no leucocyte esterase, no 

ketones.  Head CT shows no acute intracranial abnormality and mild 

involutional changes.  EKG shows a sinus rhythm at 57 beats per 

minute with non-specific T wave changes.  This is compared to an 

EKG from 2068 and was found to be without significant change.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 

in the Emergency Department with labs and studies obtained as 

documented above.  The initial concerns were for a focal seizure 

versus a TIA.  The patient was hypertensive on her arrival and, 

therefore, received labetalol for improved blood pressure control 

and the Neurology Service was consulted early in the patient's 

care.  The patient does not have any evidence of focal motor group 

weakness at this time, nor sensation changes.  The patient will 

require admission to the Neurology Service for further workup of 

her seizure versus TIA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  TIA.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.
