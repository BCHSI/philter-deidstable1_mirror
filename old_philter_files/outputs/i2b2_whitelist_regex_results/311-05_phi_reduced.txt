MEDICATIONS Metoprolol , the patient missed two doses today , aspirin , simvastatin , glyburide and NovoLog . ALLERGIES Erythromycin and IV dye . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Temperature **PHI** , heart rate **PHI** , respiratory rate **PHI** , blood pressure **PHI** **PHI** , O2 **PHI** % on **PHI** liters . The patient is awake and alert , well developed , well nourished , talking in complete sentences , in no acute distress . ENT Atraumatic , normal to inspection . Eyes are normal . Neck Normal to inspection , supple , and nontender . Respiratory Clear to auscultation bilaterally . Cardiovascular Regular rate and rhythm . No murmurs , rubs , or **PHI** .

Mood and affect is normal . Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact . No motor or sensory deficits . EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE Initial EKG showed a rate of about **PHI** , unclear . It **PHI** that there was T waves in V3 . There is no evidence of ST elevation MI . We thought this could be an SVT . It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation . Our plan was to give adenosine , however , during the IV placement . Prior to giving adenosine , the patient converted to a normal sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around **PHI** , but it was clear that there was T waves . At this point , we decided to give her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses . LABORATORY DATA Labs checked include sodium of **PHI** , potassium **PHI** , chloride **PHI** , bicarbonate **PHI** , BUN **PHI** , creatinine **PHI** , glucose **PHI** . ALT **PHI** , AST **PHI** , CK **PHI** , alkaline phosphatase **PHI** , total bilirubin **PHI** , CK MB **PHI** , troponin I less than **PHI** , calcium **PHI** , and mag **PHI** . White blood cells **PHI** , hematocrit **PHI** , and platelets **PHI** , **PHI** . INR is **PHI** . UA is negative for infection with trace blood present . PLAN Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations . If both of those enzymes are negative , we feel that she is safe to go home from the ED Observation Unit . It is unclear the etiology of her arrhythmia . It did seem to be likely SVT , which broke spontaneously . The patient is to follow up with her primary doctor . DISPOSITION ED Observation Unit . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE Satisfactory . I confirm that I have **PHI** and examined the patient , reviewed the resident 's documentation , the patient 's chart , discussed the evaluation , plan of care , and disposition with the patient . **PHI** , **PHI** M.D .
