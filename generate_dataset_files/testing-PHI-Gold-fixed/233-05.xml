EDVISIT^12953473^PICKETT, SHILPA^06/27/69^RICO, WILLARD

The patient was seen with Dr. Mueller.  I confirmed her history and

physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient.  Please

see her note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a

several-week history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, which

has worsened over the past 3 days, per the patient and her son. 

These episodes are "gassy feeling" in the epigastrium associated

with nausea and vomiting and lightheadedness.  No chest pain, no

shortness of breath.  Of note, the patient has a history of

coronary artery disease with atypical symptoms.  She has also had

a history of pancreatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake and alert, in no distress at

this time.  Afebrile with a pulse of 62, blood pressure 140/60,

and O2 sat 100% on room air.  Neck is supple with no signs of

meningismus.  Head is atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Lungs

are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart has regular rate

and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness to

palpation.  No guarding or rebound on my exam.  Extremities are

warm and well perfused.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's IV access was

established.  Labs were drawn revealing white count of 8,

hematocrit of 39.  BUN and creatinine of 36 and 1.5, which is

normal for the patient.  LFTs are normal.  Lipase is slightly

elevated at 67.  Troponin less than assay.  Urinalysis 25-30

white cells.  The patient's EKG was left bundle-branch block,

which is unchanged.  KUB shows no air fluid levels.  This patient

has a possible mild pancreatitis as well as a mild urinary tract

infection.  In addition, she has multiple cardiac risk factors

and an EKG, which will not allow for conventional cardiac stress

testing.

She will be admitted the hospital for enzymatic rule out MI with

a possible necessity to have a stress MIBI as well as to give IV

antibiotics for urinary tract infection and hydration and serial

exams for her probable pancreatitis.  The patient was admitted to

the floor in stable condition.
