 Record date **PHI** NAME **PHI** MRN **PHI** The patient is here as a walk in. Her spouse is present. Patient says she is status post a fall this past Monday at home. Says that she seems to have lost her balance while opening a door at home. Denies prodromal symptoms including shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. There was no loss of consciousness. Patient was seen in the emergency room that day for trauma to the head. Had a negative CT of her head and had an x ray of her pelvis, as she complained of some hip pain. Both studies were negative. Patient was then sent home with Roxicet. Patient was seen in the walk in clinic at CPI yesterday, after noticing a swollen tongue and some difficulty swallowing. Patient was immediately told to stop both her Roxicet and Monopril and was treated for angioedema with Zantac and Claritin. Today patient has no further throat tightness or tongue swelling. She is, however, uncomfortable continuing the Effexor for unclear reasons and wants to stop it. Patient is also complaining of severe low back pain, which she says has persisted since her fall on Monday. Did not have an x ray of the area. Says it is very painful to sit. Roxicet was not helping. She is off her Ultram as well. PHYSICAL EXAM WD overweight female in NAD. Vital signs as per LMR, WNL. Weight 213 pounds. Lungs clear bilateral breath sounds. Cor RRR, S1, S2, without murmur or S3 noted. Back slightly bent gait. Tenderness over lower sacrum. No asymmetry or obvious deformity. X ray of sacrum **PHI** could not see fracture as per my reading. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN (1) Angioedema. Agree that most likely culprits are Roxicet since it was started only two days ago, and ACE inhibitors which have been associated with angioedema. Currently on Lopressor and Dyazide, patient's blood pressure is WNL. So will follow for now. (2) Low back pain. Reviewed the possibility of a coccygeal fracture for which treatment would not be any different than pain management and a donut pillow. Patient was given a prescription for the pillow. She was told to look out for signs of nerve compression and to go to the ER if she experienced any perianal numbness or incontinence. Will notify patient by phone if x ray shows a fracture. (3) Depression. Did not feel I was able to speak freely in front of the patient's spouse. Had been put on the Effexor by Dr. **PHI**. Advised patient to let her psychiatrist know that we are tapering her off of the Effexor. Will take 25 mg q.o.d. for the next week. (4) Pain control. Will switch from Vicodin to Vicodin ES 1 q. 6 as needed. Knows to go to ER if experiences any symptoms consistent with angioedema. Return to clinic in approximately one month. **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**
