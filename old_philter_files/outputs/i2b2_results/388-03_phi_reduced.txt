The chest is clear to auscultation . The heart sounds are regular . There are no rubs or gallops . The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require attention . ASSESSMENT AND PLAN A 76 year old woman with a past history of hyperthyroidism , which was treated with I 131 with good results who , last year before she left the country , had a subnormal TSH . She does not have obvious symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4 . Diabetes continues to be a problem . Glycemic control continues to be difficult to achieve . Today , I have reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o . q.d . The son is going to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she is not taking this medicine at this point . The other medications were continued . It is indeed possible that she will need insulin in the near future . I plan close followup and will see her again in six weeks ' time . If she is hyperthyroid , this may also explain the difficulty in achieving glycemic control . Against this is the high cholesterol . She used to be on Lipitor , which was discontinued during her trip to Ghana . I have reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o . q.d . I have also added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o . q.d . to protect her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . eScription document **PHI** **PHI** DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
