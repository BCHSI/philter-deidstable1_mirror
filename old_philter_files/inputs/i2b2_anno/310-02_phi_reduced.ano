 Record date **PHI** MANAMANA nfectious Disease Consultation Note Patient **PHI** ( **PHI**) Student **PHI**, MS 4 ID Fellow **PHI** MD ID Attending **PHI** MD Referring Physician **PHI** MD Date of Consult **PHI** Reason for consult cough, nightsweats and weightloss, two days prior to transplant HPI 66 yo M with h o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome. He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in **PHI**. He was free of disease since then until **PHI**. He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31). His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome. He was considered for a allogenic stem cell transplant. His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since **PHI**. It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down. And only occasionally does he produce any sputum. He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of **PHI**). In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis. In **PHI** he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro. On pre transplant work up, CXR revealed increase conspicuity of ill defined LL zone opacity. CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation related changes. Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced. He recalls nightsweats as the fevers broke. He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months. He denies SOB (unless he s severely anemic), orthopnea, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, CP, palpitations, angina like symptoms, acid reflux, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, dysuria, frequency, nocturia, joint or muscle pain. He does have mild peripheral neuropathy in his feet bilaterally.

He recently gave his indoor cat away as he hypothesized that she had something to do with his cough MDS. He does not recall tick bites and has infrequently visited Storting and Capitol.

There is a new left sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC. No pneumothorax is seen . Impression 66 yo M with h o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non infectious diagnoses. Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP. However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered. Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient. While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis. I ( **PHI**) have interviewed and examined Mr. **PHI**, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note. My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP COP. An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious). Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated. We recommend the following work up Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture Induced sputum for PCP Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia) Fungal stain and culture Urine histo antigen Serum cryptococcal antigen Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D glucan Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture If the above work up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy sooner rather than later. It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol). Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. **PHI** and Dr. **PHI** of the patient s primary team. Thank you for this consult.
