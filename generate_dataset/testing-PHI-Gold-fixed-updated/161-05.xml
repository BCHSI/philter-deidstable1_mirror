He is awaiting CABG but does not have good conduits as expected given his extensive PVD.  Plastic surgery is evaluating patient for potential grafts.  CNI pending pre-op.



Pump: Patient was quickly weaned off all pressors.  TTE was obtained on 12/05/73.  EF was 38%, mild MR, LA dilatation, LV is dilated and fxn is moderately impaired (inf/post/lat dysfunction).  There were echodensities noted in the LV apex which may be trabeculations, however, thrombus cannot be excluded.  He has received prn doses of lasix (responds to 80 IV) and we are continuing his BB and ACE-I.  Goal TBB is ~-1.0 L.
