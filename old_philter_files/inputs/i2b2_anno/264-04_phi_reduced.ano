HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 67 year old female with end stage cardiac disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy, who I see together with the resident. The resident's history was reviewed. The patient was interviewed and examined by me. In brief, apparently the EMS was summoned to the scene inadvertently this morning. She is end stage, she is on hospice and comfort measures only, and she apparently was quite poorly feeling this morning and was transported. Her son has called several times and wants to transport her back in a discussion with her. She is quite weak and understands her circumstances, wishes to be transported back as well.

The case was discussed with her cardiologist, social worker, case manager, and family and she is discharged home. IMPRESSION End stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.
