 Record date **PHI** Neurology Resident ED Consult Note Patient Name **PHI** , **PHI** MRN **PHI** Date **PHIDate** PCP Dr. **PHI** **PHI** Ly CC right sided weakness HPI The patient is a **PHI** year old right handed Dutch speaking female with history of DM , PVD presenting to ED with right sided weakness which started yesterday morning . The patient 's grand nephew is translating , initially , then joined by Dutch interpreter ; history is challenging to obtain . The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on **PHIDate** , she **PHI** that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb . She apparently had come to the ED about **PHI** days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past **PHI** **PHI** months , but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam , and she was not admitted . She was given a **PHI** day course of Levaquin for UTI . She states that despite the pain in the RLE **PHI** days ago , she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight . She also noted that her RUE was weak , and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed . She was unable to walk independently since yesterday , and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom . She has had no facial weakness . She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg , but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in **PHI** which completely resolved . She states that she has had a mild right sided headache since yesterday AM . Since this morning , she has had nausea and vomiting as well ( did not have this yesterday ), and has not had any fevers or chest pain . She has had SOB today . She reports having frequent BLE spasms , usually at night , and her legs become quite restless .

MRI MRA head and neck Not yet completed . Recent MRI of L spine **PHIDate** The vertebral bodies , posterior elements , and alignment are intact . Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at L5 S1 , and less prominently elsewhere . There is straightening of the lumbar spine . **PHI** , L1 L2 , L2 L3 , L3 L4 Normal caliber canal and foramina . L4 L5 Mild **PHI** bulge and facet hypertrophy is not associated with significant stenosis . L5 S1 Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum hypertrophy and **PHI** disk protrusion mildly **PHI** the central canal and mildly **PHI** each foramen . There is narrowing of the lateral **PHI** on each side , and may be impingement of the **PHI** S1 nerve roots , more prominent on the right , as seen in images **PHI** and **PHI** of the axial sequence . **PHI** CT brain **PHIDate** Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are not uncommon for a patient of this age . There are no regions of hypoattenuation within the brain to suggest a prior infarction . Basal ganglia and basis pontis appear normal without evidence of lacunar infarction . No significant periventricular white matter changes are evident . IMPRESSION **PHI** year old right handed female with h o DM , PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness , onset **PHIDate** AM . She has had numbness tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past **PHI** **PHI** months likely due to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI ( L5 S1 ). She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new , as is the weakness in the RUE . Additionally , she has new nausea vomiting and SOB since this AM . While in the ED , following her CT scans , she was tachycardic to the **PHI** and hypertensive to the **PHI** systolic . She had persistent nausea and vomiting . Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings . She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE , but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds . Her RLE symptoms are likely **PHI** by her lumbar spine disease at L5 S1 as noted above . She is hyperglycemic ( serum glucose **PHI** ), has a mild leukocytosis , is iron deficient , and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology . She appears to have vasculopathic changes **PHI** in the brain seen as **PHI** on the CT today , all appearing old . She does not have any right facial weakness , no dysarthria , no aphasia , no flaccidity spasticity , no gaze preference . While stroke can not be ruled out , her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome . Ddx includes seizure , infection or metabolic abnormality causing **PHI** of stroke like symptoms , migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical metabolic abnormalities . RECOMMENDATIONS **PHI** . MRI MRA of the head and neck ( stroke protocol ), as well as MRI of C spine given UE symptoms **PHI** . We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues ( severe HTN , SOB as yet unexplained , N V , hyperglycemia ). **PHI** . BP control Labetolol to maintain BP less than **PHI** systolic ; avoid large rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure . Would allow some degree of hypertension ( **PHI** **PHI** SBP ) until stroke protocol MRI MRA obtained . **PHI** . Glycemic control need to clarify home insulin regimen **PHI** . **PHI** cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to **PHI** **PHI** . F u PE protocol CT ( done in ED ). **PHI** . Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service . This case was discussed with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** MD , senior Neurology resident . **PHI** **PHI** , MD Resident in Neurology Pager # **PHI**
