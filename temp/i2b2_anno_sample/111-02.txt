PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT This patient is a 58 year old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presents with fever and chills. He is four weeks status post revision of an aorto bifemoral bypass graft, which got infected and had to be revised. He has been doing well, but now presents here with a low grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was taking Advil for the fever). He presents for evaluation. He has had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin for the past two months secondary to his graft infection. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY As above. MEDICATIONS IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. ALLERGIES No known drug allergies.

There are some crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal. The heart has a regular rate and rhythm. The abdomen is soft and non tender, with good bowel sounds.

THERAPY RENDERED COURSE IN ED The patient was seen by Surgery. The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending.

Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent. A Surgery consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were pending. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and disposition. The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP) Surgery. FINAL DIAGNOSIS Fever.
