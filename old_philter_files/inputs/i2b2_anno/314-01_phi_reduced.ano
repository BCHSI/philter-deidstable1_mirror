Her history is well known to you but I will repeat it for our records. She has a long history of cigarette smoking with a 3 packet per day history for 30 years, stopping 15 years ago. She has developed claudication, particularly in the right leg, over the last year since her husband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved by rest. This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also in the right thigh as well. She had segmental leg pressures done which shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an ankle brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg. An MR angiogram showed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this as yet. She has intercurrent problems with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, which she has had for 10 years. Her other cardiac risk factors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of myocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her cholesterol level is. She has no history of hypertension, although I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the past. She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for a bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in swallowing tablets and keeping them down. She also has a past history of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma that had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive therapy. She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was uneventful. Systems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding, weakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual disturbances, and all other systems are negative. She lives alone, and her current medications include insulin only. She has no allergies. On physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any signs of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis. Her heart rate was 85 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 160 85 in both arms. The jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid upstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible. Her apex beat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second heart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops. Her chest was clear to percussion and auscultation. She had no hepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations. She had the scars from previous operations present. Her femoral pulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side without bruits. She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on the right leg. There were no trophic changes in her legs. She had reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf level in a stocking distribution. Her ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities. Assessment This lady obviously has severe claudication and requires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any myocardial ischemia. I therefore think a stress test is required. She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and this will prove a problem for the long term management of her atherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate. Plan I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess for myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk. I have also asked her to start on a small dose of a beta blocker for reducing her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure, which is elevated. I have also asked her to have a fasting blood lipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is likely that she would benefit from lipid lowering therapy. I plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after her operation so that we can manage her in the long term. I will let you know the results of her stress test when they become available. Thank you for allowing me to take part in this lady's care.
