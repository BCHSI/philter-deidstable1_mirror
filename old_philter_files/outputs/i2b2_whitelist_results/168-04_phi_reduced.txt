NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL FINDINGS . CXR : Cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema . The findings are more prominent then the prior study from **PHI** x-ray . EKG : NSR **PHI** with **PHI** in I and TWI in L unchanged from **PHI** Impression : **PHI** yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity . His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits . The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency , opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy . He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners . Recommendations :- check UA , NH3 - lower systolic blood pressure to below **PHI** , e.g . with Labetalol . - Give 2g **PHI** ( given renal **PHI** ), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal . - Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity - Check **PHI** to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr **PHI** **PHI** Thank you for this interesting consult . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D Resident in Neurology Pgr **PHI**
