 Record date **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHIDate** HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms. **PHI** returns for followup after her angioplasty of a superficial femoral artery occlusive disease , with a more proximal left iliac stent placement of the common iliac . She has a nonhealing left great toe ulceration . She is followed by Dr. **PHI** , and I performed an endovascular recanalization . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Today , she is doing well , after her procedure on **PHIDate** . IMAGING Noninvasive vascular lab studies were performed today , showing an ABI on the left of 0.67 on the right of 0.42 . This is a great improvement from the 0.24 ABI on the left before the endovascular procedure . ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Dr. **PHI** explained to the patient and family about toe amputation recommendations at this time . Otherwise , from a circulatory standpoint , we counseled them that this was the optimal time to perform toe amputation to allow for primary healing . They will follow up with Dr. **PHI** in 2 weeks , once they decide . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
