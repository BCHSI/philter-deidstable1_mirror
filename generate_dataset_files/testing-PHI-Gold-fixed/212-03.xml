Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

His current blood sugar readings are fasting 95-131 but 2 hrs after meals in the afternoon and evening have ranges from 159-276. he says his diet has been reasonable with a few exceptions when he has cheated and his blood sugar did reflect what he ate. I believe it`s time to change him to Lantus for better coverage. 

P I will change his NPH to Lantus 10units at bedtime he will continue testing at least twice a day and he says he is going to test at least 4x`s a day for a while. he is still on glucotrol which we may need to discontinue as not to increase his hypoglcemic episodes. I will mail him scripts to fill at his request and call him to review blood sugars and need for titration in about 2 weeks to give him enough time to be on the insulin for at least 1 week. 7/15/84 Home BS quite good! Low 100s 9/12/84.....In general, he has been failing at home, unable to care for himself, and requiring increasing VNA.
