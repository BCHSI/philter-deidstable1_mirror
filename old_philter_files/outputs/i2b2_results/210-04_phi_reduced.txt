The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non zero troponin are also concerning . Other etiologies include anxiety ( pt described a sense of doom ), pulmonary causes ( less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia ), musculoskeletal ( pt denies trauma ), PE ( pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic ).

The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease . Other possibilities include Plavix effect ( although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix ), alcohol ( although pt claims abstinence ), or ITP .
