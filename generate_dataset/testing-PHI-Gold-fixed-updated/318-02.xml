KEKELA INPATIENT DIALYSIS ADMIT NOTE





NAME: Marsh, Carl

MRN: 99579205



Primary Care MD: Xavier T. Mccoy



Outpatient Nephrologist: Keith Tierney

Outpatient Dialysis Unit:  Sanford Memorial Hospital, S and T

Estimated dry weight: 61 kg

Dialysis access: left AVF



Reason for admission:    body jerking    since last night



HPI: 



74 year old Turkmenistan male with a past medical history of ESRD presumably secondary to HTN presents to the KEKELA ED with complaints of    body jerking    since last night.  The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.  The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.  Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.  He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.  It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.  The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.  He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).  It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.  He has been symptom-free since that time.



He reports no other new events.  He denies any new medications.

ASSESSMENT:



74 year old male who presents with:



1.)	Myoclonus   unclear etiology without obvious precipitants; the last time this happened, it was in the setting of not getting dialyzed after three days.  While he did get dialysis yesterday per his normal schedule, it is odd that his potassium today is 5.5, suggesting perhaps either dietary indiscretion (which he denies) or, perhaps, inadequate dialysis.  In addition, he says that his dialysis center has been taking him off    early    a few times in the past week, though he notes that he got a full run yesterday (3    hours)

2.)	chronic HD

3.)	h/o MGUS   shoulder fat pads



PLAN:



1.)	Admit to Renal Medicine service, Dr. Tierney attending

2.)	Will plan on dialysis tomorrow for two reasons: (1) high potassium, (2) see if this helps with myoclonus

3.)	Will contact dialysis center tomorrow to see if any problems with his runs, and what his most recent URR or Kt/V was

4.)	continue Phos-Lo 2001 tid with meals

5.)	Kayexalate 30 po tonight for elevated potassium



Discussed with Dr. Tierney
