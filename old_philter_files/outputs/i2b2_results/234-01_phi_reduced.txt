Mrs. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** is a 72 year old Hispanic female who presents with a new onset acute MI . She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease , but has a long history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension . She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago , when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort . She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission , when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath . She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new onset ST segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well . There was also poor R wave progression V1 through V3 . She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure . She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation . There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex . The right coronary artery was small with a 70 % proximal stenosis . The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug eluting stent . She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg . She had an estimated 70 % ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis . Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739 . She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation . Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d . and atenolol 50 mg q.d . She also has insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin . Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy . Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use . She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country . Review of systems show no fever , chills , nausea , or vomiting . On exam , she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160 80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular . Followup pressure 125 80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute . Head and neck were unremarkable . Chest is clear . Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees . PMI is normal . S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split . There is an S4 and a **PHIDate** systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to **PHIDate** holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border . There is no S3 . Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly . Bowel sounds are normal . Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis . Calf site is clean without bruits . Distal pulse is decreased but palpable . Her resting 12 lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI . Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes , hematocrit is 44.4 %, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000 . Liver function tests are normal . A portable chest x ray shows pulmonary edema . Mrs. **PHI** **PHI** clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation . She has had her circumflex , which is a very large vessel , well treated now with a drug eluting stent , and her wedge has come down , and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved . At this point , we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin , Plavix , heparin , continue the **PHI** , as well as Lasix and nitrates . We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated , and also plan beta blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands . She certainly has co existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD . At this point , if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia , we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery . **PHI** Ferris , MD Dictated By **PHI** Ferris eScription document **PHI** BFFocus DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
