ATTENDING &#8211; Ingle


Consult indication &#8211; Pt with ESRD, consulted for HD needs


HPI &#8211; 
64 yo F with ho ESRD due to DM on HD TTS, Type 2 DM, CVA, prior GI bleeds -&gt; admitted for probable PNA and colitis -&gt; consulted for HD needs.



Recently admitted 8/27-8/30/97 for HTN urgency, N/V, and CT findings of asc colon thickening suggestive of colitis. 
BP controlled with IV and oral medications and UF on HD. Was seen by GI consult who felt that CT findings were an artifact in context of volume overload. Cdif toxin x 1 negative, was also given ivermectin for positive stronyloides serology.  Was d/c&#8217;ed on vanc x 2 weeks with HD for sacral decub ulcer.



Admitted from NGH with N/V, abd pain.  In ER, had BP 204/99, nl HR, RR, and was afebrile. Had CT a/p with contrast showing resolution of asc colon thickening, now with sigmoid/rectal thickening concerning for infectious colitis, also with LLL opacity possible pna; cdif x 1 negative.  Per ER notes, had bloody BM overnight. Received vanc 1 g, cefepime 1 g, and flagyl 500 mg.




Pt currently endorses abd pain localized to LLQ; denies melena, hematochezia.  Has had N/V x 1 day, no hematemsis.  Denies fevers, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, rash.  Makes small amt of urine, no dysuria.  All other ROS evaluated and found to be negative.

IMPRESSION - 

1. ESRD
 - HD today 3 hrs (12/97 was undergoing 2.5 hr HD runs, but 9/97 was undergoing 3 hr runs; will measure URR and Kt/V), 2K/2.5Ca, 3L UF, no EPO, zemplar 1 mcg.  No heparin with HD given possible GI bleed.


2. ACCESS &#8211; During 8/97 admission, was to undergo fistulogram but per notes from last 9/97 admission AVF was functioning well.  Good thrill/bruit on exam. Place sign over bed indicating no BP's/IV's/blood draws from LUE.


3. ANEMIA &#8211; 
Hb currently high, but per ER notes had bloody stool overnight (per signout from current ER nurse and resident, no recurrence of hematochezia), has not had sufficient time to equilibrate.  Will hold EPO for now, would consider serial CBC's.  Consider GI consult given hematochezia, sigmoid c/rectal thickening on CT; distribution of colon involvement not in watershed area, but given extensive atherosclerotic disease, ischemic colitis possible in addition to infectious etiologies.




4. MINERALS &#8211; 
Phos at goal, on phoslo 1 tab po tidac.  PTH below goal, will give low dose zemplar 1 mcg IV.  VIt 25oh D low 8/27/97, may have already received course of ergo, will repeat levels and if &lt; 30, will need addtl course ergocalciferol.


5. VOLUME/HTN &#8211; 
Pt with elevated BP, volume up on exam; CT study also demonstrates pleural effusions, mild ascites, and diffuse soft tissue edema.  Pre-HD wt not obtained, will aim for 3L UF (EDW 48 kg).


6. NUTRITION &#8211; 
1.5L fluid restrict, 2g K restrict, continue nephrocaps.  Continue labetalol and lisinopril.


7. HEMATOCHEZIA - See #3.


8. LUNG OPACITY - Received vanc and cefepime for possible pna in ER prior to arrival on HD. Vanc not given on HD.  Would give addtl dose of cefepime 1 g today after HD.  Blood cx's x 2 drawn on HD.


Pt to be discussed with Dr. Ingle.

Renal Staff Addendum


Patient seen and examined on dialysis. Discussed with Renal Fellow. Agree with details per her note. Admitted with nausea vomiting abdominal pain and accelerated hypertension. Initial evaluation notable for pulmonary infiltrate and colonic thickening with mildly elevated WBC cnt. On exam Afebrile with BP initially 180 decreasing to 110 on dialysis. Chest exam notable for crackles with O2 sat 97%. Is not in overt CHF although appears volume overloaded with peripheral edema. Abdominal exam benign despite CT findings.
Labs showing hyperkalemia.


Dialysis: 3 hrs 2K bath
Ultrafiltration: 2L
Anemia management: Epogen on hold due t dialysis
CVD: optimize dry wt and anti-hypertensives
ID: broadly covered with Vancomycin and Cefeopime; r/o C diff
