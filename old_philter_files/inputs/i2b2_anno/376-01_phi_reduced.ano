A myleogram done on **PHI** showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4 5. He will be seeing Dr. **PHI**. Mr. **PHI** is contemplating surgery as he cannot walk without pain. Elevated blood sugar BS was 191 in **PHI** and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical. He has been on meds for NIDDM. He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and is now seeing endocrine. His HBA1c was 7.5 in **PHI** on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage 500 mg qd. He has regular optho exam and is on zestoretic. Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace inh. His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor. To see endocrine in **PHI**. hyperlipidemia now on lipitor 40 mg qhs. He has NIDDM and HTN. His lipid profile from **PHI** showed a LDL of 103. LFT were normal. COntinue med. HYPERTENSION Now on zestoretic 20 25 qd + atenolol 50 mg qd.

His PSA was 2.9 in **PHI** and 3.2 in **PHI**. To see Dr. **PHI** soon. Neurological symptoms he reports having intolerance to bright lights, tingling in his mid anterior abdomen and chest as well as numbness in his left middle three digits with some neck discomfort. His MRI of his LS spine done at Montreal Medical in early 2070 evidently showed (by his report) no cord abnormalities. His sx's sound like left sided cervical radiculopathy but his visual and abdominal sx's makes me concerned about systemic demyelinating conditions. Will check TSH, B12 and have him see Dr. **PHI**. [ **PHI**] TSH and B12 levels were normal. His sx's in his eyes and abdomen have essentially resolved. He still has some cervical radiculopathy syptoms. He will see Dr. **PHI** (yet to do so). [ **PHI**] still did not see Dr. **PHI**. He now has right neck pain. His left sided numbness has resolved. Again referred him to Dr. **PHI**. He likely has cervical radiculopathy.
