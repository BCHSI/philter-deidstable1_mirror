 Record date : **PHI** CARDIOLOGY **PHI** CARE CENTER Reason for visit : Elective cardiac catheterization prior to CABG Interval History : Cardiology admission note for Dr. **PHI** This is an **PHI** year old male with CAD , DM , HTN , hyperlipidemia , and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent , which was placed in **PHI** in the setting of an STEMI . This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. **PHI** on **PHI** . Mr. **PHI** 's cardiac history began in **PHI** , when he was **PHI** **PHI** . At that time , he developed dizziness , diaphoresis and nausea . He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately **PHI** minutes . His initial EKG showed **PHI** mm STE in II , III and aVF and **PHI** mm STE in V5 and V6 . An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a **PHI** of **PHI** mm in V3 . He never developed chest pain . An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease . The LAD had a proximal **PHI** % stenosis . The LCx had mid **PHI** % diffuse disease . The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of **PHI** %. The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated **PHI** % stenosis with haziness . Given these findings , a **PHI** X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result . His peak CK was **PHI** during that admission . An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study , which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis . He was discharged home in **PHI** in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. **PHI** in his office to discuss possible CABG . It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present . He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. **PHI** on **PHI** . The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint . He denies any chest pain , dyspnea , dizziness , pedal edema , orthopnea , PND , or syncope . He does report some bilateral thigh claudication , **PHI** that he can walk about **PHI** **PHI** before he has to stop secondary to leg pain . He denies any calf pain .
