to hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia.  Unfortunately, I
do not have records but there was some question of whether this
was related to asthma, allergies or CHF.  He has had two pillow
orthopnea and worsening edema than in the past.  He has also
noted some more exertional dyspnea.  He denies cough, wheeze,
hemoptysis.  ? PND.

5.   Diabetes mellitus.  Continues on oral agents and has been
quite good with his diet.  Weight is actually down 10 pounds

femoral bruits but no complaints of claudication.  

9.   Osteoarthritis/left knee pain.  He is status post left TKR
by Dr. Robles last year.  Unfortunately had a knee injury down in
West Virginia this spring and has quite a bit of problem with swelling
and pain.  He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with
Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema
and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation.  He is
now carefully using ibuprofen and has follow up scheduled with
Dr. Robles.

proteinuria.  Biopsy consistent with diabetic nephropathy.
