DATE OF VISIT **PHIDate** REASON FOR VISIT Reassessment of progress , s p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma , **PHI** stage IIB , s p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy ( **PHIDate** ) with pathologic tumor stage **PHI** ( **PHIDate** involved lymph nodes ). POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes , he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo radiation therapy . He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using **PHI** , planned with **PHI** CT simulation . This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , and **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** **PHI** is a 77 year old gentleman with a history of smoking , chronic GERD , HTN , CAD s p PCI , partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2 . He was in his **PHI** until **PHIDate** when he began to have difficulty swallowing . While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation . He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then , which have generally resolved within 10 15 minutes without regurgitation . In **PHIDate** his PCP prescribed a PPI , which helped somewhat , but he continued to have dysphagia . On **PHIDate** EGD at **PHI** Hospital demonstrated a partially obstructing distal esophageal mass 34 39 cm from the incisors , associated with Barrett &# 8217 ; s esophagus , with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma . On **PHIDate** CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus . On **PHIDate** repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R sided pleural thickening . Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35 40 cm with 9 mm thickness , suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria , one suspicious mediastinal LN , and porta hepatis adenopathy . On **PHIDate** FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative . He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on **PHIDate** . Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring **PHI** cm , invading into muscularis propria ( pT2 ) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN ( N1 ). INTERVAL HISTORY REVIEW OF SYSTEMS He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms . He has maintained steady energy and appetite . He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat . Otherwise , he has been doing well . He denies significant respiratory symptoms . No focal or generalized neurological symptoms . The remainder of review of systems was unremarkable .
