Internal Medicine B Admission Note PATIENT : **PHI** Wilhelm MRN : **PHI** ADMIT DATE : **PHI** ATTENDING : **PHI** Thomson PCP : **PHI** Frey CONTACT : **PHI** **PHI** ( HCP , daughter ) **PHI** ; **PHI** ( son ) **PHI** Code status : Full Source : patient , son , records CC : N/V , poor PO intake HPI : Ms. Wilhelm is a **PHI** **PHI** woman with a history of HOCM , HTN , DM , and sarcoidosis who underwent a Hartmann &# **PHI** ; s procedure with small bowel resection on **PHI** after which she was discharged to **PHI** Center on **PHI** and then **PHI** to MEDIQUIK on **PHI** with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a saddle pulmonary embolus as well as large right lower extremity DVT . She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to **PHI** Center on **PHI** and now presents with nausea , vomiting , and several days of poor PO intake . This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &# **PHI** ; first in **PHI** when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis . She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery ( although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite ) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery . The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day . The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis . She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days . She denies fevers , chills , headaches , cough , abdominal pain , or change in the character of her colostomy output . ED COURSE : On arrival to the ED , vitals were as follows : **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** , **PHI** % /RA . Her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended . CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified . She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed . She was given 2L of IVF and morphine 2mg IV x2 . ROS As above , otherwise reports baseline blurry vision ( has been told of cataracts in the past ). Denies SOB , cough , CP , chest pressure , orthopnea , palpitations . Foley catheter in place but denies suprapubic tenderness .

Heart and mediastinum : The heart and the mediastinum are normal . CT Abd ( **PHI** ): LOWER THORAX : There been interval resolution of the previously identified bilateral pleural effusions . There is linear atelectasis of the lung bases . HEPATOBILIARY : No focal hepatic lesions . No biliary ductal dilatation . There are stable findings of porcelain gallbladder . SPLEEN : No splenomegaly . PANCREAS : No focal masses or ductal dilatation . ADRENALS : No adrenal nodules . **PHI** : No hydronephrosis , stones , or solid mass lesions . Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified , stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts . PELVIC **PHI** : There is a Foley catheter in place . There is a fibroid uterus . PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM : No free air is seen . There is trace free fluid . LYMPH NODES : No lymphadenopathy . VESSELS : There are scattered vascular calcifications . An IVC filter is in place . GI TRACT : There is diffuse dilation of the proximal and mid small bowel with multiple air fluid levels . There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated . There has been a prior a prior colostomy . There is diverticulosis . BONES AND SOFT TISSUES : Unremarkable . IMPRESSION : Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified . Alternately , this could reflect ileus . Close clinical follow up advised . EKG : NSR at **PHI** , leftward axis , biatrial enlargement , normal PR interval , narrow QRS , LVH , **PHI** in I , aVL ASSESSMENT & amp ; PLAN Ms. Wilhelm is a **PHI** **PHI** woman with a history of HOCM , hypertension , sarcoidosis , diabetes , who underwent a Hartmann &# **PHI** ; s procedure with small bowel resection on **PHI** and was **PHI** on **PHI** with a saddle PE and large RLE DVT for which she was managed with IVC filter and anticoagulation who now presents with several days of nausea and vomiting and concern for small bowel obstruction on CT. SBO : Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction ( although ileus remains a possibility . Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely . Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time . Appreciate surgery input NGT to low wall suction NPO except meds for bowel rest Serial abdominal exams Check colostomy output guaiac Acute renal failure : Her creatinine was up from a baseline of **PHI** to **PHI** on admission . With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to **PHI** so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting . Continue IVF while NPO Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs Anemia : Baseline hematocrit in low **PHI** , last **PHI** prior to discharge on **PHI** . She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing . She likely either has **PHI** anemia ( although she has been taking iron supplements ) or anemia of chronic disease &# **PHI** ; or a combination thereof . Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis . Transfuse **PHI** **PHI** Check colostomy guaiac Check iron studies , reticulocyte count Elevated **PHI** : She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large **PHI** s/p IVC filter placement . She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin . She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding . Hold Coumadin for now Follow up INR , goal **PHI** **PHI** : Continue lopressor , verapamil Sarcoid : Continue Prednisone at 5mg daily PAF Continue Amiodarone &# **PHI** ; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio F/E/N : NPO PPX : coumadin , PPI , bowel regimen CODE : Full **PHI** **PHI** S **PHI** , MD , Pager # **PHI**
