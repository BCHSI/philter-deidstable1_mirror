MICRO:  BCX sent; stool sent for fecal leukocytes, C. diff, O&P



Colonoscopy:  08/20/2073 - normal colon.



Abd/Pelvic CT:  

Air within the gastroepiploic and portal vessels as described, without specific bowel pathology.  Heterogeneously enhancing masses within the pelvis as described, likely representing exophytic uterine fibroids.  Recommend ultrasound of the pelvis for confirmation.  Possible small gallstone within the gallbladder without CT evidence for cholecystitis.  Fatty liver.



CXR:  	NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA OR CHF.



KUB:  NO EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION OR PERFORATION.



EKG:  NSR at 90 bpm, diffusely flattened T waves, no ST abnormalities 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

60 year old woman presents with a history of watery diarrhea, gas and diffuse abdominal pain for the past two weeks that has increased in intensity in the last 3 days.  For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.  No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.  Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.  Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.  Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.  Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.



1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.  This history is suggestive of overflow diarrhea.  Patient denies recent narcotic usage and no obstructing lesions are seen on CT scan.  May also be infection, malabsorption, osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or a motility defect.  No evidence is seen for ischemia, inflammation or infection.  Bowel dysmotility resulting from DM may play a role in a motility disorder.

 - Diet: clears now, NPO after midnight

 - Stool for fecal leukocytes, O&P, C. diff

 - Bowel regimen:  colace, senokot, miralax

 - Reglan PRN nausea

- Follow clinical exam

 - Follow WBC, T, lactate for signs of acute sepsis or ischemia

 - Appreciate GI input (Dr. Utterback)

 - Apprecate surgery input (Dr. Espinosa)

 - Ranitidine prophylaxis, zofran PRN nausea



2) Gyn:  Patient is s/p breast cancer and has fibroids.  No evidence of abdominal mass other than fibroids.

 - Continue on tamoxifen 20 mg PO QAM



3) Psychiatric:  Depression & anxiety

 - Buspar

 - clonazepam

 - effexor



4) DM2:  Continue home meds (metformin + insulin), hold when on diet without substantial calories (clears, NPO)



5) Prophylaxis:  patient is ambulatory; ranitidine; commode by bedside.
