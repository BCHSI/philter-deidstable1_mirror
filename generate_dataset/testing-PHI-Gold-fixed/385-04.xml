EDVISIT^89659991^MOSS, DEREK^03/11/89^GODFREY, XAVIER GEORGE

I saw this patient with the resident, Dr. Louvinia Duvall.  Please

see her note for further details.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male

with a history of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation,

congestive heart failure, prostate cancer, chronic renal

insufficiency, and Parkinson disease previously hospitalized 2

weeks prior for right lower extremity cellulitis, which he had a

PICC line placed, and was discharged to home on vancomycin. 

Since that time, he has had progressively increase in his

creatinines despite decreasing doses of vancomycin.  He was

concerned and requested that the patient to come in for a

possible acute renal failure secondary to the antibiotic.  There

is also concern that cellulitis had worsened, as the patient was

experiencing increasing weakness.  He is denying currently any

fevers, chills, or constitutional symptoms.  His baseline

shortness of breath has been going on for months.  No GI

complaints.  He has had a mild headache, but no visual changes,

no focal motor or sensory loss.

MEDICATIONS:  He has a long list of medications Please see the

chart.

and in no acute distress.  Vital signs reviewed and found to be

within normal limits.  Afebrile at 95.6.  HEENT exam is

Lungs are clear bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm,

no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, and

nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and dry.

small ulcerations and serosanguineous drainage is minimal.  No

evidence of pus.  It is about where it was at the start based on

the initial skin markings.

150 and creatinine of 3.  This has significantly increased from

his baseline of 1.8-2 he has had in the past.  Vancomycin level
