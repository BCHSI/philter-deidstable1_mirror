Chief Complaint

Dyspnea and exertional chest discomfort 



History of Present Illness

Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.

Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE. Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.  He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.   He refused further work-up or intervention until recently. He presents now for cath and surgery.
