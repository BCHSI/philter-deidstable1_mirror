He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in **PHI** **PHI** . He underwent PTA Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral Profunda arteries . As you know , he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left . He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft , patent **PHI** graft , and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA . He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time . Additionally , he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis . He returns today for review . He remains in reasonable health . He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery . He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit , on each side .

Impression Mr **PHI** is a 74 year old gentleman with extensive PAD **PHI** now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication . He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia . Finally , he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids . Assessment and plan 1 . CAD will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test . 2 . PAD worsening claudication , will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re intervene . 3 . Carotid disease ; currently asymptomatic , will repeat CANIs .
