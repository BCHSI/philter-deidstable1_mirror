At that time , the patient noted that **PHI** **PHI** mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth , as well as poor oral intake with associated **PHI** lb weight loss . In early **PHI** , she presented to the walk in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT.**PHI** **PHI**  CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes . The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter , and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid , lupus like syndromes , Castleman 's , and indolent lymphoma . Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of **PHI** with Alb of **PHI** , a mild **PHI** in the **PHI** , LDH of **PHI** , ACE of **PHI** , normal TSH , HCT of **PHI** , ESR of **PHI** , SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase , positive ANA at **PHI** **PHI** with nuclear pore staining ( highly specific for biliary cirrhosis ), elevated **PHI** at **PHI** , and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at **PHI** and **PHI** , respectively and negative HIV . The patient s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF , lasix at times , and a dose of bisphosphonate , which led to a decrease in Ca to **PHI** . Axillary lymph node biopsy **PHIDate** revealed non specific follicular hyperplasia , though to be consistent with a reactive process . Oncology was **PHI** , and a lymphoma work up was **PHI** ; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells , CD4+ and CD8+ T cells , with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population . **PHI** CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary , mediastinal , and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further **PHI** to diagnostic **PHI** . The patient underwent pulmonary function testing , which showed a reduction in the FEV1 , FVC , and **PHI** ratio ; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal , resistance and specific conductance were normal , and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced . On **PHIDate** , a bronchoscopy was attempted , but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure , and it was not performed . Thoracic surgery was **PHI** and recommended that the patient be **PHI** in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia . Fungal antibodies were sent , and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization . Since discharge , the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued , and has not felt like eating . She reports significant acid reflux , saying only water goes down and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth .
