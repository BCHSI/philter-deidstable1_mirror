 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** Light , M.D . Internal Medicine **PHI** Memorial Hospital RE **PHI** **PHI** MR # **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Mrs. **PHI** presents to the office today for general cardiac evaluation . As her history is well known to you , I will repeat it briefly for our records . Mrs. **PHI** is a 47 year old woman with a history of variegata porphyria , insulin dependent diabetes and significant coronary artery disease . In 2061 , after a four to five day history of retrosternal chest discomfort , she was admitted to the **PHI** Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography revealed a 95 % proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis . She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with inadequate results . She therefore was taken electively for coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to her LAD . She subsequently continued to have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in **PHI** of **PHI** at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60 % stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50 % stenosis in the mid right coronary artery . The catheterization report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary artery graft . Since then , she has continued to have episodes of intermittent abdominal discomfort . She recently has undergone an extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered . Trials of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective . In **PHI** of **PHI** , she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131 , peak blood pressure of 188 82 stopping because of fatigue . She had no ischemic changes on electrocardiogram . Over the past two weeks however , she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome ( which she often describes as feeling like indigestion ) now includes radiation to her left shoulder . The pain is not exacerbated by position , time of day or any particular activity . The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest . Of note , her lipid profile from **PHI** **PHI** indicates a cholesterol of 229 , triglyceride of 68 , HDL 51 , LDL of 164 . **PHI** , **PHI** MR # **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria , insulin dependent diabetes , right hand carpal tunnel syndrome , Dupuytren's contracture and tendinitis and hypertension . Medications at Present Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM , **PHI** 10 units sub q qAM . Allergies None . Cigarettes none . Ethanol social . Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma , mother dying of colon cancer , question coronary disease , one brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25 , another brother dying from melanoma age 36 . The rest of her siblings and children have not heart disease . Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress . Blood pressure right arm sitting 110 64 , heart rate 85 and regular , respirations 12 and unlabored , weight 104 pounds . The neck is supple . JVP flat . Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right greater than left bruits . Chest is clear . Cardiac exam shows a normal S1 , physiologically split S2 and a I VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base , no significant diastolic murmur . The abdomen is benign . Extremities reveal no appreciable edema . Peripheral pulses are intact . Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85 . PR interval of **PHI** , QRS **PHI** , QT **PHI** , axis 85 degrees . There are minor nonspecific ST T wave changes . Impression Mrs. **PHI** is a 47 year old woman with a history of variegata porphyria , insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension and dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease . She has had a retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show significant provokable ischemia . Nonetheless , I am concerned that her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia . I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive studies . In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin dependent diabetes , I strongly recommend beginning aggressive antilipemic pharmacologic therapy . Unless her variegata porphyria precludes the use of atorvastatin , I would begin this at 10 mg po q.d . I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90 . In addition , I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d . and I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her porphyria does not **PHI** , **PHI** MR # **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** preclude this . She understands that if she has evidence for significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her to undergo repeat coronary angiography . Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care . Sincerely yours , **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
