 Record date **PHI** CARDIOLOGY PRIMGHAR CARE CENTER Reason for visit Elective cardiac catheterization prior to CABG Interval History Cardiology admission note for Dr. **PHI** This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in **PHI** in the setting of an STEMI. This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. **PHI** on **PHI**. Mr. **PHI**'s cardiac history began in **PHI**, when he was shoveling snow. At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea. He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes. His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6. An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3. He never developed chest pain. An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease. The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis. The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease. The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%. The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness. Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result. His peak CK was 305 during that admission. An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis. He was discharged home in **PHI** in stable condition and follow up with Dr. **PHI** in his office to discuss possible CABG. It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present. He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. **PHI** on **PHI**. The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint. He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope. He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain. He denies any calf pain. Past medical history 1. CAD 2. DM 3.

Proceed with cardiac catheterization today He will be premedicated with Mucomyst and Bicarb. given his renal function. Continue ASA and statin Will need to stop Plavix given upcoming surgery next week. BP borderline high today will monitor during the procedure, adjusting his medications as needed.
