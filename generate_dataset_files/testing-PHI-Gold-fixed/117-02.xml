Most recent stress test done 11/63 showed that patient had a normal exercise capacity, METS=8,  EKG that was negative for ischemia in response to stress, and myocardial scans were within normal limits and did not show evidence of ischemia or infarction.  Cardiac ultrasound done 10/62 showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function, no segmental wall motion abnormalities, and an EF of 62%.
