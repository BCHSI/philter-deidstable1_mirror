Attending: Dr. Ickes
PCP:     Orvell Oliver MD


CC/ID: 82M w/ h/o HTN, CRI, DM2 and + h/o smoking w/ no known CAD p/w syncope and an inferior STEMI 


HPI:  82M w/ h/o HTN, CRI, DM2 and + h/o smoking w/ no known CAD p/w syncope and an inferior STEMI. Pt has been in his USOH.  This AM while shoveling snow he started to feel &#8220;unwell&#8221; c/o dizziness, slightly nauseous and sweaty.  He denied CP, SOB/V/diaphoresis. He may have had a similar event 3 years ago during heavy exertion (1 episode).  He felt this was like prior hypoglycemic episodes.  Pt went inside, called for his wife and then syncopized. Estimated total LOC ~5 min.  He awoke as his wife returned to give him the OJ and felt completely better after drinking it. arrived to find the pt with STEMI in inf leads. Pt was given asa and was taken to the ED for further management. 


ED course: Pt was bradycardic but hemodynamically stable P59, BP112/63). He was found to have a new RBBB and new STE in 2, 3, avf and V3-V6 with depressions in 1, avl. Pt had no chest pain through out the entire duration, but felt generally unwell. Was started on heparin, lipitor, NAC and cardiology was called. 


Pt was taken to the cath lab and found to have 3VD w/ severe proximal LAD lesion, a diffusely diseased Cx/OM2, and a severe RCA lesion, which was felt to be the culprit. A BMS to RCA lesion. Pt was plavix loaded and started on a bicarb drip.   


ROS:  Per HPI. No F/C/NS.  No SOB/cough/hemoptysis/wheezing/sore throat/rash.  No GI/GU complaints.

A/P: 82M w/ h/o HTN, CRI, DM2 but no known CAD p/w syncope, new RBBB and inferior STEMI.  Intervention on acute lesion today and possible may get re-eval for left-sided circulation with either staged PCI v. CABG.  



Ischemia: 

ASA/plavix, heparin, integrilin. Lipitor.
CE until peak
A1c/lipids, BB if room. 
Staged PCI vs. CABG
Pump: Pending TTE 

Has not tolerated ACEI before. Can consider ARB if BP room. If difficulty w/ hyperkalemia could consider small standing doses of kayexolate.
Currently appears euvolimic
Rhythm: Sinus w/ old LAHB, new 1st degree AVB and new RBBB.  Given right-sided lesion at risk for complete HB.  

Observe for now. Hold BB
Per AHA guidelines class I transcutaneous if develops CHB.
Holding BB for now.
