HOSPITAL COURSE: 


PAF/ Flutter: In the Ed, he had been given IV lopressor 5mg  w/ 25mg PO lopressor w/o improvement and then was given 10mg IV dilt which brought HR down to 90s. He was also given 0.5mg digoxin for possible dig load. Given he was failing on Toprol 100mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 60mg q6hr to see if a different drug class might help. Cardiology/ EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic. EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 80-mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 120mg BID on 6/15 if Qtc remains stable ( &lt;500 msec). He is planned to received 5 doses of sotalol prior to dispo and if he remained in aflutter through 6/15 is to get DCCV on 6/16. He received his first and only dose in the pm 6/14.
