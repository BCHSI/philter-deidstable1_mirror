She was doing well until **PHI** **PHI** , when she presented with a non-healing ulcer and gangrene in her L third toe and subsequently underwent a redo L **PHI** tibial bypass using R basilic and cephalic veins on **PHI** . On **PHI** she had graft scanning , which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and **PHI** indices at that time were normal bilaterally . However , she presented on **PHI** c/o L foot pain . On physical exam , she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe . She now presents with increasing pain ,&# **PHI** ; **PHI** &# **PHI** ; on scale **PHI** that is constant in nature , with occasional **PHI** spikes in intensity . She also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the L foot , but there is no paresthesia . She denies CP , SOB , N/V , flank pain , or any urinary Sx and has no history of cardiac disease .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : **PHI** y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD , s/p several bypasses , presenting with worsening L foot pain of two **PHI** duration . On physical exam , L foot is **PHI** tender and while it is warm to touch , it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe . In addition , ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of **PHI** . The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L **PHI** tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy , however , she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely . - oxycodone for pain control , continue neurontin - continue home atenolol , ASA , Valsartan - NPO from midnight , pepcid - check **PHI** , CBC , coags - has an insulin pump - angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** IV **PHI** Patient seen and examined . Agree with medical student note above . Briefly , **PHI** with DM I , HTN , hyperlipidemia s/p bilateral revascularization procedures for PVD presents with complaints of left foot pain limiting walking to several feet as well as with small ulcers on her toes . ABIs are very diminished on the left and graft scan shows elevated velocities at proximal anastomosis . She is admitted in anticipation of angiography in am .
