 Record date **PHI** CARDIOLOGY PORT HURON HOSPITAL Reason for visit 77 year old woman with mitral stenosis, S P redoMVR for thrombosed St. Jude valve, now with porcine MVR, AS, COPD, S P R total hip replacement. Interval History Mrs. **PHI** has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, hypertension and COPD. She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085. Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker. She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis. Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction. Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder. Mrs. **PHI** is S P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital. She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over and under diuresis, respectively. She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140 145 pounds, which is her target weight. Her BUN and Cr are in the 25 40 1.3 1.7 range. Since her last visit, she has done well at home. Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes. However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion. She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. **PHI** arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC. She feels more energetic after this. She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this. She may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. **PHI**. This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. **PHI**, and her pulmonologist Dr. **PHI**.

TLC is normal. FRC is normal. RV is increased. RV TLC ratio is increased. Resistance is increased; specific conductance is decreased. Single breath diffusion capacity is severely reduced, although there was only one adequate maneuver performed and thus reproducibility cannot be assured. DL VA is reduced. These data demonstrate a mild obstructive ventilatory deficit. The spirometry obtained today are similar to those from **PHI**. Resting room air oxygen saturation is below normal limits, and there is significant arterial oxygen desaturation with exertion. **PHI**, M.D. **PHI**, M.D. * end of report * Assessment and plan 77 year old woman S P redo MVR, AS, CHF, COPD, S P R hip replacement.
