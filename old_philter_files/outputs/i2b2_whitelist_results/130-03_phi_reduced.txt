She **PHI** dialysis in **PHI** . She had a second transplant in **PHI** , which was also complicated and ultimately rejected . She **PHI** hemodialysis in **PHI** . She does have a match with her only daughter , but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries , which would be required , one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant .

She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a **PHI** bit sad . She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos . She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop , which has made walking difficult . She did have a brace at one time , which helped her to walk , but it was irritating . She had seen Dr. **PHI** to get another one , but that never worked out . She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath , no constipation .
