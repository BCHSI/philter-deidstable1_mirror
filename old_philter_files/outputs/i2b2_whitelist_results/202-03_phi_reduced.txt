 Record date : **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Y. Dill , M.D . Southwest Colorado Medical Health Center **PHI** **PHI** Street Suite **PHI** **PHI** , NE **PHI** Dear Dr. Dill : DOB : **PHI** Thank you for referring Mr. **PHI** to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation . As you know him well , I will summarize his history briefly for our records . Mr. **PHI** is a **PHI** gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories , a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately **PHI** %, and atrial fibrillation . In addition , he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia , and obstructive sleep apnea . In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed , he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA . He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea . On further questioning , he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively **PHI** distances around his home or up and down the driveway . He can walk no further than approximately **PHI** feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue . He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent . He has undergone multiple **PHI** most recently in **PHI** , but was unsuccessful . Prior to that , cardioversion in February **PHI** in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt **PHI** improved . He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of **PHI** left-sided chest discomfort . Cardiac catheterization on **PHI** revealed a **PHI** % LAD **PHI** restenosis , **PHI** % septal lesion , and **PHI** % **PHI** % PDA lesion that was stented . A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of **PHI** %. Other than significant exertional shortness of breath , he feels relatively well . He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope . He denies any PND , orthopnea , or lower extremity swelling . He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations . His weight has been stable . On review of systems , he denies any fevers , chills , or night sweats . His weight has **PHI** stable . He denies any new onset cough , wheezing , or hemoptysis . Past Medical History : **PHI** . CAD status post LAD **PHI** in **PHI** . He developed **PHI** restenosis in **PHI** , during which time he received a second **PHI** stent to the LAD lesion . He developed recurrent chest discomfort in **PHI** , and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an **PHI** % mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a **PHI** % proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis . He underwent a **PHI** stent to the mid LAD lesion . A followup catheterization in **PHI** revealed a **PHI** % LAD stenosis , **PHI** % large septal branch lesion , and a **PHI** % proximal PDA stenosis . Ventriculogram revealed an EF of **PHI** %. He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on **PHI** . An exercise **PHI** performed in **PHI** revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia . **PHI** . Hypertension . **PHI** . Dyslipidemia . **PHI** . Diabetes . **PHI** . Obstructive sleep apnea . **PHI** . COPD , prescribed home oxygen , though he is not taking this . **PHI** . Carotid disease , status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax . **PHI**? History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in **PHI** . **PHI** . Atrial fibrillation . **PHI** . Obesity . He has no known drug allergies . His current medications include amiodarone **PHI** mg BLANK , but this has been discontinued since **PHI** , metoprolol **PHI** mg b.i.d., digoxin **PHI** mg daily , Zocor **PHI** mg daily , Plavix **PHI** mg daily , TriCor **PHI** mg daily , Lasix **PHI** mg daily , BLANK **PHI** mg nightly , aspirin **PHI** mg daily , Lantus insulin **PHI** units daily , Humalog insulin , and Protonix **PHI** mg daily . His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence . He was formally employed in **PHI** construction . He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection . He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol . His family history is negative for early onset CAD , sudden cardiac death , or cardiomyopathy . His father lived until the age of **PHI** . His mother died of a stroke at the age of **PHI** . He has a single sister who is **PHI** years of age and has no history of heart **PHI** . Physical Examination : His blood pressure is **PHI** BLANK of **PHI** beats per minute . In general , he is overweight elderly man in no distress . Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the **PHI** . Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally . Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases , but otherwise clear . There is no wheezing . Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2 . There is no audible murmur , rub or gallop . Abdomen is obese , soft , and nontender . Lower extremities are warm and well perfused . There is trace pitting edema at the ankles . Recent blood work reveals an INR of **PHI** on **PHI** . EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately **PHI** beats per minute . There are some nonspecific **PHI** abnormalities , but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes . There is some low voltage in the limb leads , though I suspect this is related to his habitus . Overall , Mr. **PHI** is a pleasant **PHI** man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath . He appears to be functional class III . He does not have any **PHI** evidence of volume overload on exam today , though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal . Moreover , he has multiple **PHI** which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease . We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. **PHI** and his family today . We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation . However , given his **PHI** and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we **PHI** that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately **PHI** month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success . Given the length of the procedure as well as his **PHI** , we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation . We will leave this decision to them . Moreover , prior to the ablation , we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation . Thank you very much for referring Mr. **PHI** to our care . We will be in touch following the procedure . As always , feel free to call with any questions .
