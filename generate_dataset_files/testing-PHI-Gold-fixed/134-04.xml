A/P: 82M w/ h/o HTN, CRI, DM2 but no known CAD p/w syncope, new RBBB and inferior STEMI.  Intervention on acute lesion today and possible may get re-eval for left-sided circulation with either staged PCI v. CABG.  



Ischemia: 

ASA/plavix, heparin, integrilin. Lipitor.
CE until peak
A1c/lipids, BB if room. 
Staged PCI vs. CABG
Pump: Pending TTE 

Has not tolerated ACEI before. Can consider ARB if BP room. If difficulty w/ hyperkalemia could consider small standing doses of kayexolate.
Currently appears euvolimic
Rhythm: Sinus w/ old LAHB, new 1st degree AVB and new RBBB.  Given right-sided lesion at risk for complete HB.  

Observe for now. Hold BB
Per AHA guidelines class I transcutaneous if develops CHB.
Holding BB for now.
