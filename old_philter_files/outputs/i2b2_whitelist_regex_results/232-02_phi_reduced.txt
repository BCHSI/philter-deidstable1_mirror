Recently admitted **PHIDate** **PHI** for HTN urgency , N V , and CT findings of asc colon thickening suggestive of colitis . BP controlled with IV and oral medications and UF on HD . Was seen by GI consult who felt that CT findings were an artifact in context of volume overload . **PHI** toxin x **PHI** negative , was also given ivermectin for positive **PHI** serology .

In ER , had BP **PHI** **PHI** , nl HR , RR , and was afebrile . **PHI** CT a p with contrast showing resolution of asc colon thickening , now with sigmoid rectal thickening concerning for infectious colitis , also with LLL opacity possible pna ; **PHI** x **PHI** negative . Per ER notes , had bloody BM overnight . Received vanc **PHI** g , cefepime **PHI** g , and flagyl **PHI** mg. Pt currently **PHI** abd pain localized to LLQ ; denies melena , hematochezia .

No heparin with HD given possible GI bleed . **PHI** . ACCESS &# **PHI** ; During **PHIDate** admission , was to undergo fistulogram but per notes from last **PHIDate** admission AVF was functioning well . Good thrill bruit on exam . Place sign over bed indicating no BP 's IV 's blood draws from LUE . **PHI** . ANEMIA &# **PHI** ; Hb currently high , but per ER notes had bloody stool overnight ( per signout from current ER nurse and resident , no recurrence of hematochezia ), has not had sufficient time to equilibrate . Will hold EPO for now , would consider serial CBC 's . Consider GI consult given hematochezia , sigmoid c rectal thickening on CT ; distribution of colon involvement not in watershed area , but given extensive atherosclerotic disease , ischemic colitis possible in addition to infectious **PHI** . **PHI** .
