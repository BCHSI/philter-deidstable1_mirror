He receives most of his care at **PHI** Clinic **PHI** ( Dr. **PHI** ). Two **PHI** ago , he had BiV ICD placement , as well as left heart catheterization that showed , per verbal report ,&# **PHI** ; multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&# **PHI** ; He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results . He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high risk CABG ( Dr.**PHI** **PHI**  ) and potential heart transplant evaluation ( Dr.**PHI** **PHI**  ). He feels that since the BiV ICD placement he has been feeling more tired , specifically in the past **PHI** days , wherein he reports fatigue , nausea , poor sleep , exertional lightheadedness . He has not had chest pain ( he did have chest pain with prior two MIs ), palpitations , vomiting , diarrhea . He does have some orthopnea , but no PND and LE swelling intermittently , but not at present . To his knowledge , he has never had a tachyarrhythmia . However , he does note that he was started on digoxin a few **PHI** ago , tried it for **PHI** week , then had fatigue , nausea , GI upset , and that the medication was then discontinued . On arrival , he had**PHI** **PHI**  , BP **PHI** **PHI** with some drops to low of **PHI** **PHI** . Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy . EP was **PHI** , **PHI** his device , and confirmed that he was in Afib ( and that it had never **PHI** or detected VT VF ). He was given amio load **PHI** and drip at 1mg min , with some HR response to **PHI** **PHI** . For hyperkalemia to **PHI** , he was given calcium gluconate , insulin , **PHI** , **PHI** ; and his Mg was **PHI** . Given his persistent symptoms , per EP **PHI** , he was started on heparin drip with **PHI** units bolus . ( He is not on Coumadin at baseline ; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only .) CXR by report was clear . With **PHI** , BPs dropped to **PHI** ; upon discontinuation , BPs back up to **PHI** , then **PHI** . Of note , he says his baseline HR is **PHI** and SBP is **PHI** .
