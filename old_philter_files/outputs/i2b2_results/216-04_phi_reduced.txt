Per a note from her neurologist , Dr. **PHI** **PHI** , Ms. **PHI** has a history of transient neurologic events , consisting of right hand numbness and weakness , in 2098 and 2099 . She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures . She was started on Depakote for this . Between **PHI** and **PHI** of **PHI** her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures . EEG in **PHI** **PHI** showed no evidence of epileptiform activity . In **PHI** **PHI** she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope . Dr. **PHI** witnessed one of these events in his office in **PHIDate** and it was associated with hypotension . Ms. **PHI** s family describes her syncopal events differently , stating that she will stare into space for 5 8 minutes , during which time she is unresponsive . When she wakes up , she is confused and sleepy for 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting . These episodes are associated with jaw clenching , but no tonic clonic movements . Ms. **PHI** does state that she feels dizzy and lightheaded before these events , and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy . She does not recall the events herself . The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence , although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted ( unclear circumstances surrounding this ). The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene it was normal . In the emergency department , Ms. **PHI** s was afebrile , 82 158 70 18 95 % on 2L . She received zofran for nausea , ASA , and IVF , and was transferred up to the floor for further management . The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position . Do not occur when bearing down , or when she is exerting herself . The episodes are not sudden she appears to have some warning before one occurs . She denies fevers chills . No chest pain , palpitations . Some shortness of breath when walking , which sounds like it is unchanged . Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ? color mucus . She takes antihypertensive medications , but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1 . Hypertension 2 . History of supraventricular tachycardia 3 .

Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation , although when compared to EKG from > **PHIDate** , this appears unchanged . CXR **PHIDate** NAD **PHI** CT **PHIDate** IMPRESSION Appearance of chest may be at baseline following right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung apex . Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of tiny lung nodules seen . MRI **PHIDate** Findings Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute ischemia . There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr hole or craniotomy . There are chronic appearing , small right cerebellar infarcts . There are scattered periventricular FLAIR and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent with small vessel ischemic change . There is FLAIR hyperintensity in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal , bilateral parietal and left occipital lobes . No abnormal enhancement is seen . The brain parenchyma , ventricles and sulci are otherwise unremarkable . The major intracranial flow voids are normal . There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus . There is partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells . There are bilateral lens implants . The bones , soft tissues and orbits are otherwise unremarkable . MRA There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right posterior cerbral artery . There is diffuse irregularity of the proximal left posterior cerebral artery . There is moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery . The distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized . There is otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of the circle of **PHI** . Impression Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior predominance as described . This could represent hemorrhage , high protein content , high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium injection . Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery , consistent with severe stenosis with clot not excluded . Diffuse irregularity of the left posterior cerebral artery . These findings could be secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but vasculitis is another possibility . Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery . No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified . Chronic right cerebellar infarction . Small vessel ischemic changes . Carotid US **PHIDate** **PHI** 1 . RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS . 2 . MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION . 3 . MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION . 4 . BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW . Echo 01 1 . Normal cavity sizes , wall thicknesses and global and regional right ventricular and left ventricular systolic function . Left ventricular ejection fraction is in the range of 60 %. There is no flattening of the interventricular septum , asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure . There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E A ratio , which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation . 2 . There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus ( very mild ) and of the interannular fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root . There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may represent atherosclerotic change . 3 . The aortic valve is trileaflet . Can not fully exclude the possibility of some thickening of the **PHI** of the aortic valve , but , alternatively , the increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent atherosclerotic change of the aorta . There is no evident aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency . Very mild mitral annular fibrosis . Otherwise , the mitral valve appears structurally normal . Normal appearing tricuspid and pulmonary leaflets . There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation . Flow velocity could not be optimally assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure . 4 . There is no evident pericardial effusion . ASSESSMENT & PLAN 1 ) Syncope Unclear etiology . History from family sounds much more like seizure . Episode in neurologist s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope .
