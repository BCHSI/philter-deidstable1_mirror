He had several courses of quinolones ( and other abx ) during this period without significant relief , but ultimately his symptoms improved on their own . His immune suppression was d c 'd **PHIDate** . He deveoloped iron overload ( Ferritin 1356 ) and started phlebotomy **PHIDate** . Mr. **PHI** did well from a respiratory standpoint until **PHIDate** when he noticed intermittent fevers approximately every 2 weeks . At first they were in the 99 range and they would last 1 2days and be associated with malaise . He also again experienced symptoms of a dry hacking cough that occurs with change in positioning ( not necessarily lying flat ). By the end of **PHI** , the fevers were a bit higher ( 100.5 ).

Cardiac MRI suggested constrictive pericarditis and possible areas of active pericarditis . Right & amp ; left heart cath which showed no evidence of **PHI** hemodynamically . He had 1 temperature to 101.4 , and given his history he was seen by our service . Blood cultures were negative . Induced sputum was negative for AFB x 3 . He and influenza rsv **PHI** **PHI** nasal swabs which were also negative . Sputum cultures grew oral flora . CMV VL , glucan , and galactomannan were also negative . He improved w regard to SOB but cough persisted . He was seen by Dr. **PHI** who was concerned for an immunologic process given his bilateral pleural effusions & amp ; question of pericarditis . He had a URI syndrome in **PHI** that lasted **PHI** weeks then resolved . On **PHI** **PHI** , he noticed the onset of low grade temps ( **PHI** ) with malaise and mild chills .
