 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** You , M.D . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** RE **PHI** **PHI** SRI **PHI** Dear Dr. You I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient , Mr. **PHI** **PHI** , in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here at the Santa **PHI** Infirmary today . As you remember , he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below knee popliteal artery . He returns today for follow up evaluation . He has a warm , well perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse . Unfortunately , over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis . He had been on a course of p.o . antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well . The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema , tenderness or drainage from his leg . My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics , bedrest and elevate . We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures , treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis . In addition , he has intact femoral pulses on the left side . He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region . Most recent vascular lab studies dated **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** reveal an ABI of **PHI** on the right , **PHI** on the left . I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. **PHI** . My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high **PHI** of losing his limb at the knee level . If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease , particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure , please feel free to contact me directly .
