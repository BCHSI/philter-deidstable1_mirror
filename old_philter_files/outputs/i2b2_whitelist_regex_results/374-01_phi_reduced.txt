Internal Medicine **PHI** Floor **PHI** Medical Center **PHI** , DE **PHI** RE **PHI** , Norma MR # **PHI** DOB **PHIDate** Dear **PHI** , Thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma **PHI** , a **PHI** year old female patient with the history of seizure disorder , hypertension , borderline diabetes , gastroesophageal reflux disease and panic related symptoms , and depressive disorder , who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness with recent **PHI** abnormalities . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS As you already know , Ms. **PHI** describes a longstanding history of snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory **PHI** , and describes a `` restless sleep '', but only relatively recently ( over the last five months , particularly after **PHIDate** of last year ). She has described marked increased daytime sleepiness . She essentially describes a nocturnal sleep pattern which involves `` sleeping around the clock '' during which time she may initiate sleep between **PHI** **PHI** and **PHI** **PHI** a.m., and after a couple **PHI** , will wake up at **PHI** **PHI** a.m., only to demonstrate frequent and often prolonged daytime **PHI** of four hours duration . The patient states she will waken for a couple of hours and then reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours . She states that she is so tired that she can `` fall asleep right after breakfast ''. She then would get up for lunch and then go right back to sleep and sustain sleep until **PHI** **PHI** p.m. in the afternoon . Ms. **PHI** also demonstrates a history of seizures initiated at **PHI** to **PHI** years of age , and was initially started on phenobarbital therapy . She later switched to Dilantin therapy , but more recently and particularly since the mid **PHI** 's , she has been on Tegretol antiepileptic monotherapy **PHI** mg tablets , four tablets po q.a.m . and three tablets po q.h.s . While Ms. **PHI** also demonstrates both daytime and nocturnal seizures , there has been increased **PHI** for nocturnal seizures over the last year , and an increased amount of `` diffuse '' spike wave discharges are evident during light sleep , as detailed during a recent **PHI** evaluation ( please see below ). CURRENT MEDICATIONS **PHI** , Celexa , Zestril , Prilosec , carbamazepine ( **PHI** mg tablets , four tablets in the morning and three tablets at night ), clonazepam , hydrochlorothiazide , Premarin , tetracycline and **PHI** con . ALLERGIES No adverse drug allergies reported . SLEEP HISTORY Sleep onset intended for **PHI** **PHI** p.m. but the patient does not often sleep until **PHI** **PHI** to **PHI** **PHI** a.m. She describes one to two early morning **PHI** , with relative ease with regards to subsequent reinitiation and maintenance . Sleep offset initially occurs at **PHI** **PHI** to **PHI** **PHI** a.m. and sometimes as late as **PHI** **PHI** a.m . The patient will then get up and right after breakfast fall asleep for several hours in duration ( up to four hours ). The patient then will reawaken and have lunch and then after a couple of hours of sustained wakefulness , will reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours of sleep . Patient may sleep until **PHI** **PHI** p.m. on certain given **PHI** . The patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory **PHI** as well as `` restless '' sleep . She denies a history of restless lower limb sensory complaints of nocturnal lower limb movements suggestive of periodic limb movement disorder . She denies the history of abnormal arousal behaviors or associated narcoleptic symptoms . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY **PHI** . Seizure disorder . **PHI** . Hypertension . **PHI** . Borderline diabetes . **PHI** . Gastroesophageal reflux disease . **PHI** . Depressive disorder . **PHI** . Panic related symptoms . SOCIAL HISTORY Patient denies active tobacco use . She has discontinued all alcoholic beverage intake due to her reflux disease . She **PHI** two **PHI** of tea per day . While **PHI** an overweight status , she has increased her weight by **PHI** **PHI** pounds over the past four years . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On examination , the patient demonstrates a mildly hypersomnolent facies . Speech is clear and fluent . Receptive language functioning essentially intact . No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated . No focal sensory motor neurologic deficits are noted . No significant appendicular **PHI** or **PHI** are currently in evidence . The routine gait appears to be normal based , without evidence of significant gait **PHI** . No current clinical ictal manifestations are present . No acute evidence of `` **PHI** '' are noted . On HEENT examination , there is evidence of a small posterior oropharyngeal **PHI** , with increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a mildly elongated uvula , as well as a high riding base of the tongue and mildly increased tonsillar size . Vital signs include a blood pressure of **PHI** **PHI** ( seated , left arm ) and a heart rate of **PHI** , with a respiratory rate of **PHI** . IMPRESSION **PHI** . Hypersomnia ( **PHI** ) Likely to be a result of frequent sleep disordered breathing events and their associated arousals . Other diagnostic **PHI** include the presence of gastroesophageal reflux associated arousals as well as nocturnal sleep disruptions due to sleep related epilepsy ( although seizures appear to be under relatively good control on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy ). **PHI** . Obstructive sleep disordered breathing ( **PHI** ) Patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and nocturnal respiratory **PHI** as well as extremely frequent intermittent obstructive apneas and a respiratory disturbance index of **PHI** per hour as noted during a recent **PHIDate** sleep study with associated O2 **PHI** down to **PHI** percent . Good clinical response to nocturnal CPAP therapy noted . **PHI** . Seizure disorder Recent literature suggests that there is a possible association between treatment of obstructive sleep disorder and increased seizure frequency in patients who are susceptible ; i.e., thereby giving a further impetus for regular ongoing home CPAP therapy . PLAN **PHI** . Suggest regular home CPAP administration ( CPAP Mallinckrodt ; **PHI** `` contour classic '' mask ; ramp time of **PHI** minutes ; warm air humidification ; at **PHI** cm of water pressure ). **PHI** . Pending clinical response , will reassess the patient 's level of alertness , decrease amount of early morning **PHI** , and possibly decrease seizure frequency at the next sleep study evaluation in **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** times . **PHI** . In addition , patient is advised to continue **PHI** at weight reduction , use of an oro dental , and or potential ENT surgical approaches may also help to improve upper airway signs and symptoms . **PHI** . Patient to continue on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy **PHI** mg tablets , four tablets po q.a.m . and three tablets po q.h.s . until an assessment of seizure frequency with nocturnal CPAP therapy has been made . **PHI** . Follow up neurologic reevaluation in our sleep study department is tentatively scheduled in **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** time . Once again , thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma **PHI** .**PHI** **PHI**  this letter finds you in the **PHI** of health . Sincerely , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Department of Sleep Studies **PHI** Medical Center ADDENDUM Sleep study results ( **PHIDate** ) **PHI** . Extremely frequent intermittent obstructive ( **PHI** ) and partially obstructive apneas ( **PHI** ) during supine sleep , as well as intermittent **PHI** ( **PHI** ) and nocturnal **PHI** , intermittent snore arousals ( **PHI** ) and episodes of moderate snoring ( respiratory disturbance index = **PHI** per hour ) with associated arousals and O2 **PHI** down to **PHI** %. Insofar as stage REM sleep was not achieved , the actual degree of respiratory compromise may be under represented . **PHI** . CPAP administration ( CPAP Mallinckrodt ; **PHI** `` contour classic '' mask ; ramp time of **PHI** minutes ; warm air humidification ; at **PHI** cm of water pressure ) served to considerably reduce the frequency of these nocturnal respiratory disturbances , help consolidate sleep , as well as improve O2 **PHI** ( i.e., to **PHI** % and above , even during REM supine sleep ) and overall sleep stage architecture . **PHI** . Slightly increased periodic limb movements of sleep , activated during both `` light '' non REM , as well as stage REM sleep ( index = **PHI** per hour ) with infrequent limb associated arousals ( index = **PHI** per hour ) both of which may serve to interfere with the continuity of sleep ( the presence of REM related nocturnal lower limb movements may suggest some degree of REM motor disinhibition ). **PHI** . Cardiac rates typically **PHI** between **PHI** **PHI** beats per minute ; average **PHI** beats per minute . **PHI** . EEG evidence of frequent bursts and brief runs of `` diffuse '' spike wave discharges were evident during light sleep , without associated clinical accompaniment . **PHI** . Inability to achieve stage REM sleep under pre CPAP conditions , but with prominent `` slow wave and REM **PHI** '' subsequently noted with CPAP administration ; i.e., accounting for more than **PHI** % and more than **PHI** % of the CPAP sleep times , respectively . **PHI** . Total recording period **PHI** minutes ; total sleep time **PHI** minutes . DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** RS **PHI** **PHI**
