PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1 . End stage renal disease . Because of her original end stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS , she had a preemptive transplant in 2068 , which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft . She resumed dialysis in 2072 . She had a second transplant in 2075 , which was also complicated and ultimately rejected . She resumed hemodialysis in 2082 . She does have a match with her only daughter , but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries , which would be required , one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant . She currently is dialyzed at the **PHI** Hospital . Her dialysis physician is Dr. **PHI** . 2 . Hypertension . 3 . Peripheral vascular disease . She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085 , which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses . She apparently does not have claudication despite this . 4 . History of right foot drop . She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot drop . 5 . History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion . 6 . History of CMV colitis in **PHIDate** . 7 . Secondary hyperparathyroidism . She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085 . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo oophorectomy for a serous cyst in **PHIDate** . She is status post appendectomy . She is status post bilateral cataract surgery . MEDICATIONS Norvasc 10 mg per day , lisinopril 20 mg per day , metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg per day , aspirin 81 mg per day , Nephrocaps 1 mg per day , Restoril 15 mg nightly , **PHI** 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week , B6 200 mg per day , vitamin E 400 mg per day , flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day . FAMILY HISTORY Significant for diabetes in her father and grandfather , negative for cancer . SOCIAL HISTORY She is a widow . She is a lifetime nonsmoker . She does not drink alcohol or use drugs . She is a retired mathematician at Vassar . She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area . She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock . ALLERGIES No known drug allergies . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility . She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad . She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos . She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot drop , which has made walking difficult . She did have a brace at one time , which helped her to walk , but it was irritating . She had seen Dr. **PHI** to get another one , but that never worked out . She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath , no constipation . She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION She is a well developed , well nourished , very pleasant , but somewhat sad appearing white female .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 1 . End stage renal disease on dialysis , not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections . 2 . Hypertension , well controlled on medications . 3 . Hyperlipidemia , on Lipitor . Last cholesterol was checked in **PHIDate** with normal ALT and AST , but elevated alkaline phosphatase . 4 . Peripheral vascular disease , currently asymptomatic . 5 . Right foot drop . We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. **PHI** . 6 . Left shoulder pain . It did mention in her physical , but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain . We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis . 7 . Hemorrhoids . 8 . Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar . 9 . Health maintenance . Mammogram was done in **PHIDate** . Pap smear was done in **PHIDate** . Colonoscopy was done in **PHIDate** . 10.? Depression . She seemed a little sad . Has had a tough time with her medical problems and never adjusted that well to Pecos .
