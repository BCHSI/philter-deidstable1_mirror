 Record date **PHI** CARDIOLOGY **PHI** MEDICAL CENTER Reason for visit Follow up visit visit Interval History 60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in **PHI** **PHI** with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST segment elevation . Known risk factors at that time ( in addition to his age and gender ) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking . Details of that presentation as per my **PHIDate** office note . Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory , one in the **PHI** RCA and two in the PLV . The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm **PHI** ( bare metal stents ) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision ( bare metal stent ). A non dominant Left Circumflex had a 70 % stenosis that was not intervened upon . There was non obstructive disease in the LAD . A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54 % and no wall motion abnormalities . Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm . RV function was normal . He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program ( see below ). He had an outpatient ETT MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease . He had this on **PHIDate** and he exercised for 6 minutes , 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70 % of predicted . He did not experience chest pain , had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue . The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia . LV EF 63 %. He had a recurrent episode of chest pain ( somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like ) and presented to the ED in **PHI** . His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec , achieving 9 METS , 80 % **PHI** , peak double product 19K . A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study limiting . The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal , without evidence of ischemia or infarction . LV EF 68 %. He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI . He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab . He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI , and has remained abstinent since then . He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath . His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain . Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain . This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time . Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG . He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work , and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities ( i.e . **PHI** in nature ). He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath , which has not changed since the onset of the CP . He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI , and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in **PHI** that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test . He denies lightheadedness or syncope . No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling . He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen . He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy . He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes . Past medical history 1 ) CAD status post inferior STEMI **PHIDate** with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory ( 1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV ).

General Looks well , overweight , pleasant HEENT Jugular venous pressure 7cm , carotids 2+ bilaterally without bruits Chest CTAB Cardiac Point of maximal impulse is midclavicular ; Distant , regular , S1 and S2 , no murmurs or rubs Abdomen Soft , obese , non tender Extremities No lower extremity edema , 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally BP 130 75 both arms EKG Baseline artifact , Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm , clockwise rotation , minor nonspecific T wave changes ; compared to **PHIDate** , the heart rate is slightly decreased , otherwise no important change . Assessment and plan 60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI **PHIDate** treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory , Hypertension , Hyperlipidemia , and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease , although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days . 1 ) Coronary artery disease Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory , and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy . Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs ( i.e . Motrin ), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point . He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily , Lipitor 20mg daily , Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily . His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled . The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to **PHI** when he had an ETT MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images . He does have a known 70 % stenosis in a non dominant LCx , but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory . His ECG today is unchanged from priors . However , given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms . I will call the patient in several days time , and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT . 2 ) Secondary prevention Most recent Lipid panel in **PHIDate** on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126 , LDL 62 , HDL 25 and **PHI** 195 . His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings . Given this , along with an elevated TG value , we will start Niaspan . He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2 3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects ( i.e . flushing ). He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects . After a few weeks , he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs . He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward . He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level . 3 ) Hypertension Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily . He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure .

So , no further testing at this point . He will call me if symptoms recur . Signed electronically by **PHI** **PHI** , MD Document Status Final
