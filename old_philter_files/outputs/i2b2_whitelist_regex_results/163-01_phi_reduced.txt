 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** RE **PHI** , Marion MRN **PHI** DOV **PHIDate** Dear Dr. **PHI** , Thanks for asking me to see Marion **PHI** who I saw on **PHI** **PHI** . She is referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia . The patient states she is currently **PHI** but was in her usual state of good health until **PHI** when she developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling . This continued to bother her and she eventually was treated with steroids . I am not sure she had a diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia . She then was switched to ibuprofen which did not work particularly well . Over this time , she would have intermittent episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in her palms , back , neck , low back , legs , and into her arms . She was seen by Dr. **PHI** at **PHI** Clinic , and no blood studies were obtained , but she states she had `` **PHI** shots '' of steroids . She denies any hot or swollen joints . She has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved . Extensive ROS reveals no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud 's . She has urgency regarding her bladder and has been **PHI** but not particularly well . She has continued to be concerned about that . She has had fevers or chills but no temperature elevation . She has intermittent abdominal pain but has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was **PHI** for this . She has morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night . Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father . Mother is **PHI** . Two sons alive and well . Two siblings alive and well except for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia . Past medical history is pertinent for above . She has had a partial hysterectomy , cholecystectomy , and fracture of her wrist . Medications include for hypertension , diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia , the following metformin **PHI** b.i.d., verapamil **PHI** b.i.d., Avapro **PHI** q.d., Pravachol **PHI** mg q.d., Bumex **PHI** q.d., cyclobenzaprine **PHI** q.d., Prilosec **PHI** q.d., and Allegra . No smoking or drinking history . No allergies . No other medical problems . Social history is pertinent in that she lives in **PHI** . She works as a midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic . Her husband is a Broadcast Technician . They have **PHI** quite a bit because of this . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . RE **PHI** , Marion MRN **PHI** Page **PHI** Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress . Weight **PHI** . BP **PHI** **PHI** . She had a respiratory rate of **PHI** . She had full range of motion of all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles , greater **PHI** , and cervical and lumbar area . Otherwise , no active synovitis or skin lesions . No oral ulcerations . Good salivary pool . No lymphadenopathy , thyromegaly , or axillary adenopathy . Chest clear to A & P . No carotid **PHI** . Vascular exam normal . Cardiac exam quiet precordium without murmur or gallop . Abdominal exam nontender without hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities without edema . I suspect she has fibromyalgia . I do not really know the place of steroids in this setting . I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK , LFTs , TSH , CBC , ESR , as well as a urine , ANA , CRP , and RF . I will see her back in four to six **PHI** . She will get old records for me to review . We will talk about what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time , but I really need to have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign . I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in .
