She was discharged on simvastatin , Plavix , as well as atenolol and lisinopril . She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us . Today , she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months , she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10 15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop . An arteriogram carried out in **PHI** of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac , external iliac , and common femoral arteries . She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time . The patient denies chest pain , palpitation , shortness of breath , orthopnea , and ankle edema . Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg , she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic .

Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria . Today , I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c , comprehensive panel , CBC , and urine analysis . I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril . I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o . q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o . q.d., and enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o . q.d . She is also to take a multivitamin q.d .
