Follow Up - post hospitalization visit



He was admitted 2/01-2/03/74 for NSTEMI.  On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm.  As a result he did not exercise that day.  The symptoms improved spontaneously.  On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine.  Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service.  Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED.  He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED.  There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive.  He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin.  When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was "pristine," LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion.  He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result.  He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix.



Today, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms.  He is feeling great.  He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise.  He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab.  He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr. Ishmael next week.  He has had no groin hematoma or other complications.
