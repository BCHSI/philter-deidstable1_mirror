 Record date **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** CLINIC Reason for visit **PHI** y o Columbian male with a history of HTN , hyperlipidemia , severe AS s p AVR ( St. **PHI** ) in **PHIDate** and recent composite **PHI** homograft replacement for MRSA VISA endocarditis presenting for follow up . Interval History The patient 's complicated cardiac history dates back to **PHIDate** when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS . He had preserved LV function and pre operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non obstructive CAD . He initially did well , but had a prolonged hospitalization in **PHIDate** . At that time , he developed acute cholecystitis and post ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation . He was admitted to PNC in **PHIDate** for elective open cholecystectomy and roux en Y cyst jejunostomy . He underwent the GI surgery on **PHIDate** . His post operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re initiation of anti coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay . Unfortunately , he developed line associated **PHI** and sepsis **PHI** **PHI** into the hospitalization . He developed high fevers on **PHIDate** ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin . He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment . He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and a TTE on **PHIDate** and TEE on **PHIDate** showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess . A follow up TEE on **PHIDate** showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. **PHI** on **PHIDate** . The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure . On POD **PHI** , he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias ( VT VF ) which required **PHI** **PHI** and open cardiac massage . A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR , and preserved LV function . Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm . An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm . HE was taken to the OR for closure on **PHIDate** . His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH , development of HIT , and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit . ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD . He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim . He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not **PHI** to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up . With supportive care , he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit . His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA . He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder . He was discharged to a rehab facility on **PHIDate** and was discharged from rehab **PHI** **PHI** ago . Since discharge , he reports doing relatively well . He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs . He is able to walk up to **PHI** **PHI** minutes continuously . He denies any chest pain , dyspnea at rest , PND , orthopnea , LE edema , palpitations , syncope , or pre syncope . He also denies any fevers , chills , or weight loss . He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant Nickel in ID earlier this month . He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP . The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim . He has completed a **PHI** week course of daptomycin . Past medical history **PHI** . MRSA VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis . Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on **PHIDate** . Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in **PHIDate** and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on **PHIDate** . Intraoperatively developed severe RV failure . **PHI** . RV failure . Complication of aortic homograft surgery . TEE on **PHIDate** showed severe RV hypokinesis and severe TR . **PHI** . HIT . Developed HIT post operatively after aortic homograft replacement in **PHIDate** . **PHI** . Coronary artery disease . Preoperative cardiac catheterization on **PHIDate** demonstrated **PHI** % focal narrowing in the left main ; proximal **PHI** % lesion in the LAD ; **PHI** % lesion in D1 ; mid **PHI** % lesion in the left circumflex , and normal RCA . **PHI** . Dry gangrene of right 3rd digit of right foot thought to be secondary to an embolic complication of IABP versus HITT . **PHI** . Hypertension . **PHI** . Hyperlipidemia .

Selected recent labs Assessment and plan **PHI** y o Columbian male with a history of HTN , hyperlipidemia , severe AS s p AVR ( St. **PHI** ) in **PHIDate** and recent composite **PHI** homograft replacement for MRSA VISA endocarditis . The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post operative course that was notable for RV failure , ARF , HIT , vascular emboli to the right foot , and mild hyperkalemia . At this point , he appears close to **PHI** by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF . HE has evidence of severe TR on exam . From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative , the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning , and he will require a prolonged course of anti biotics as **PHI** by Dr. Infant Nickel . His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active , acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection . PLAN **PHI** . PVE endocarditis . He is s p composite aortic homograft replacement . He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID . We will obtain CBC , chem panel , LFTs , ESR , CRP per ID today . He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** post operatively . We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. **PHI** next week . **PHI** . RV failure . Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion . We will continue his current dose of lasix . Dry weight **PHI** **PHI** lbs . I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity . We anticipate some recovery of RV function . **PHI** . ARF . Resolved . We will check a follow up chem panel today . **PHI** . Right foot gangrene . Involvement of the right 3rd toe with no wet gangrene or signs of infection . ABI testing in **PHIDate** showed no PAD . He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. Werner in vascular surgery . **PHI** . CAD . Non obstructive disease . Continue ASA , atenolol and lipitor . We will hold on ACE inhibitor given hyperkalemia issues . **PHI** . Hyperkalemia . Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim . **PHI** will check follow up chem panel today . He will need monitoring of K and we can consider **PHI** therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim . Patient will return to clinic in **PHI** months for follow up . Patient seen with Dr. **PHI** .
