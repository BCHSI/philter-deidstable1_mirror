 Record date **PHI** Cookson Memorial Home Internal Medicine Room 960 **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**, SC **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** CHIEF COMPLAINT Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall, reevaluate Coumadin. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Urgent care visit for this 77 year old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues. Last week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation. It was a very very windy day. Afterwards she was outside and a huge gust of wind knocked her over. Her daughter **PHI** was with her and **PHI** herself actually had to hold on to something when the wind blew. There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode. She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and left eyebrow. She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head CT. A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the lateral edge of her left eyebrow. She had films of her wrist and hips both of which were fine. She has bruising in these areas. Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely back to normal. She had marked hypertension up to 250. She was treated with hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with some hematuria. Her blood pressure at home since then has been 180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril. She is not on a beta blocker currently. She has not had any episodes of chest pain. She does feel slightly more woozy than usual. MEDICATIONS Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin, lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., levothyroxine 100 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax. SOCIAL HISTORY She is looking forward to a good **PHI**. She is here today with her daughter **PHI**. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208 66, weight 148 pounds. GENERAL Well appearing woman. HEENT PERRL. Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left eyebrow is easily removed. No evidence of any infection. Her left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the shoulder. Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any bony step offs. She walks well with no pain in her left hip. There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric bursa. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Mechanical fall with laceration and bruising but no more serious complications. Fortunately she did not have intracranial bleeding. I am not sure why her blood pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the falls verses independent causes. Given that the high blood pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d., and discuss via phone or E mail with her daughter next week to see how well this is working. Goal BP 140 160 systolic. Her urine was checked today. Hematuria has resolved. She has 2+ proteinuria. I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat her hypertension. We spent over half of today's 45 minute visit discussing risks and benefits of Coumadin therapy. Although she is at risk for falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke. She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke. I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial hemorrhage and its consequences. I spoke with Dr. **PHI** last month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at increased risk for falls. It seems to me that she is in a gray area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis for Coumadin for her. She feels very strongly that she wishes to continue. This was discussed in detail with her and her daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision. I encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall. More than half of today's 45 minute visit spent in patient counseling and education. **PHI**, M.D. Dictated By **PHI** eScription document **PHI** EMSSten Tel DD **PHI** DT **PHI** DV **PHI**
