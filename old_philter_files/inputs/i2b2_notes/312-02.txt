Patient Name: 	Ethridge, Clayton

Medical Record #: 	8381729

Date of Admission: 	01/08/64
Attending: 		Dr. Burton



CC/ID:	clotted AV fistula / renal failure



HPI: 	The patient is a 55 year old male with a past medical history significant for chronic renal failure (secondary to diabetes & hypertension) and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who underwent an arteriovenous graft placement ten days prior to admission. The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse. Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill. The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment. 



	In the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit. The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.



Of note, the patient denies any pain  / numbness / coolness in his hand. He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight. He does indicate that he has suffered from decreased oral intake lately secondary to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite.
