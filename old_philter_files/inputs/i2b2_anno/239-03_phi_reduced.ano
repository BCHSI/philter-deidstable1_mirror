EXAM T 100.4, P 110, BP 150 80, R 26, SO2 94%(4L) NAD, limited cooperation with exam, A+O x2 CV tachy reg, no rubs CHEST CTA ant ABD soft, NT ND NABS EXT 1+ edema Neuro nonfocal limited exam DATAEKG is not available for review, but no acute ischemic changes and no widened QRS peaked T wave per ED. PCXR poor penetration, but no acute process Head CT IMPRESSION 1. No hemorrhage, mass lesion, or evidence of acute territorial infarction. 2. Extensive nonspecific periventricular, deep, and subcortical white matter changes are likely sequela from chronic microangiopathic disease. 3. Old lacunar infarctions in the left caudate head and right caudate anterior corona radiata. Evaluation for acute ischemia is limited in the areas of extensive white matter disease. Brain MRI with diffusion weighted imaging is more sensitive in assessing for acute ischemia and should be obtained as clinically indicated.
