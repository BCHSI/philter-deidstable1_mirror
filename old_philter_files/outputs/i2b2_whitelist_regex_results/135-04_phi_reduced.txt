TLC is normal . FRC is normal . RV is increased . RV TLC ratio is increased . Resistance is increased ; specific conductance is decreased . Single breath diffusion capacity is severely reduced , although there was only one adequate maneuver performed and thus reproducibility can not be assured . DL VA is reduced . These data demonstrate a mild obstructive ventilatory deficit . The spirometry obtained today are similar to those from **PHIDate** .
