 Record date : **PHI** CARDIOLOGY OAKLAND ASSOCIATES CENTER Interval History : This **PHI** y/o male patient with a h/o HTN , HLP , **PHI** **PHI** CAD , preserved LV systolic function , PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA , tobacco abuse , type **PHI** DM , peripheral neuropathy , L ulnar nerve compression , ulcerative colitis , GERD , depressive disorder , anxiety disorder , and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure . The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** at the OAC **PHI** , at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms , RLE > LLE , with pain in his buttocks , thighs , and calves with ambulation . He reports that these symptoms , coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms , have become quite **PHI** and **PHI** . The patient denies any chronic or **PHI** ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities . Given his history and symptomatic complaints , Dr. **PHI** recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and , if indicated and feasible , to pursue percutaneous revascularization . The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on **PHI** , performed by Dr. **PHI** , which **PHI** in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA , the former with a **PHI** biliary stent and the latter with a **PHI** biliary stent . Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in **PHI** revealed a depressed resting ABI of **PHI** in the RLE , which dropped to **PHI** following exercise ( as well as a resting ABI of **PHI** in the LLE which decreased to **PHI** post-exercise ). The patient has not been treated with **PHI** in the past . An important side note is the fact that the patient 's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in **PHI** revealed significant **PHI** CAD , which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously . The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today 's peripheral catheterization procedure , not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future .

Assessment and plan : ASSESSMENT : **PHI** y/o male patient with a h/o HTN , HLP , **PHI** **PHI** CAD , preserved LV systolic function , PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA , tobacco abuse , type **PHI** DM , peripheral neuropathy , L ulnar nerve compression , ulcerative colitis , GERD , depressive disorder , anxiety disorder , and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms ( RLE > LLE ). In addition , a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well , particularly because of the patient 's known **PHI** multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression . The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest , hemodynamically stable , in sinus rhythm , **PHI** on room air , in no distress , and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today . PLAN : **PHI** . Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning , which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography ( +/- possible percutaneous revascularization ). **PHI** . Informed written consent obtained from the patient ( by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow ) pre-procedure this morning . **PHI** . No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically **PHI** prior to angiography . **PHI** . Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. **PHI** post-procedure . **PHI** . Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA , Plavix , **PHI** , Lisinopril , and Zocor . **PHI** . Continue holding the patient 's prior Metformin for **PHI** hours following contrast administration during angiography today . **PHI** . Monitor the patient 's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia . **PHI** . Continue the patient on Glipizide , a PPI ( Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [ formulary limitations ]), Neurontin , Effexor , Chantix , Hytrin , and **PHI** . **PHI** . Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following : CBC , **PHI** , Mg , **PHI** , **PHI** , Lipoprotein ( a ), and Homocysteine . **PHI** . Discharge timing will depend upon today 's procedural findings and events , the patient 's peri- and post-catheterization course , and the potential need for further monitoring , testing , or treatment in the inpatient setting . **PHI** . Following his hospital discharge , the patient should see Dr. **PHI** in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately **PHI** - **PHI** **PHI** , with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies ( particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs ) at that time . **PHI** . Will re-address with Dr. **PHI** the need to consider the patient 's need for coronary arterial revascularization , either percutaneously or surgically , given the severity and multi-vessel involvement . **PHI** .
