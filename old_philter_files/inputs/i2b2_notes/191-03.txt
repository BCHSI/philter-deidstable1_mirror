MICU Intern Admission Note

Faulkner, Yandel

MR#5075561

Date of Admission: October 28, 2094

PCP: Lord, Dana  



ID/CC:	GI Bleed



HPI:  	 69 yo man w/ h/o AAA, PVD, CAD, AF w/ tracheostomy and G-tube in place, on coumadin for PVD, HIT +,  and DVT w/ INR yesterday of 5.3.  Noticed black stools x 1 day, and blood suctioned form G-tube.  Came to ED and while in ED waiting for a room had an episode of  near syncope. In ED 97.6, Pulse 82, BP 110/62 RR 20. In ED received 4 units FFP, 2 uPRBCs, and Zantac.  GI saw him then and EGD showed large clot in fundus of stomach, but unable to find source of active bleeding.  Duodenum was visualized up to the 3rd portion was normal.

	Shortly after transfer to floor he  was noted to have hematemesis, then became pulseless and went into Vfib arrest.  Pt trached and was bagged.  After cardioversion x 2, he reverted to sinus rhythm which again returned to asystole.  After 1 mg of epinephrine he regained pulse and rhythm was sinus tachycardia.  Triple lumen placed in R groin and Cordis in L groin.  EKG w/ ST depressions in lateral leads.  

	Repeat EGD in MICU showed ulcer 2 cm from GE junction w/ protrusion and question of visible vessel.  Angioectasia / active oozing.  Both tx'd c/ bipolar resulting in good hemostasis.

MICRO:



CXR:  Clear lungs.



CTA 8/11/94: The patient is status post infrarenal abdominal aortic endograft

placement. No endoleak is identified. The left limb of the graft is occluded throughout its entire extent.  There is mural thrombus identified in the proximal aspect of the graft circumferentially.	The left limb is again noted to extend into the left external iliac artery.  The distal right limb terminates in the right	common iliac artery. There is a normally patent right to left femoral femoral bypass graft. The aneurysm sac, previously measuring 55 x 51 mm, now measures 53 x 50 mm.



ECHO 2/94: EF > 50% Trace to mild mitral regurgitation. There are thin mobile echoes associated with the aortic valve leaflets most c/w Lambl's excresence.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler.  There are atheroma in the aorta but no protruding or mobile components.The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.  There is evidence of a large pleural effusion.



EGD 1/94: - Savary-Miller Grade III reflux esophagitis.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm w/ 1st degree AV block. Q in I, AVL, and II, II, AVF.  T wave inversion in V2-V6.  

 



___________________________________________



Impression:

70 yo man with history of CAD, AAA repair, vasculopath, presents with GI bleed most likely secondary to gastric ulcer, EKG changes with fast rhythm, bump in cardiac enzymes.





Plan: 

GI Bleed

-	NPO

-	Repeat EGD 48 hrs

-	Follow HCT q 6h and transfuse for HCT<30

-	Acid suppression w/ IV zantac

-	Received FFP/Vit K to reverse coumadin

-	will check H. pylori serologies

PVD

-	Will have to monitor extremities w/ acute reversal of anticoagulation

-	Will need to restart anticoagulation once stable from GI perspective

CV

Ischemia

-	Patient w/ EKG changes in setting of arrest.  Trend CKs

-	Holdng ASA

-	follow EKG's

-	unable to give beta-blockade at the moment due to low BP

-	history of elevated troponins due to CKD

Pump

		BP borderline with low HCT, required Levo to keep pressures up for sedation

	

Pulm

-	may have aspirated in setting of arrest, CXR clear though

-	will hold Abx at this time.  If WBC rises or spikes w/ begin antibiotics

-	required vent support briefly with sedation



Access

-	will need to change femoral lines to IJ since placed emergently during code



CKD: Acute renal insult on top of CKD. Creatinine responded to volume (PRBCs and fluid).

ID: is supposed to be on chronic suppressive doxycycline for history of MRSA, but at the moment no meds PO, so will hold

Prophylaxis: Head of bed should be 30 degrees, pneumoboots, Zantac.
