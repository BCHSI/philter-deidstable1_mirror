There have been no other neurological symptoms , and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness . Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity , without facial involvement . He has pronator drift on the right , with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right , and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE . He has no sensory findings , and no dysarthria or aphasia . **PHI** was zero . CT Brain shows loss of **PHI** white differentiation in Left MCA territory , with Left M1 clot . There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution . The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD .
