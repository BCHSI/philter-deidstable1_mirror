Reason for visit

			

  Followup of multiple issues.



History of present illness

			

  Since his last visit, the patient has had two episodes of pressure in his chest.  This occurred approximately one week ago in the setting of walking up the stairs and carrying a heavy package.  He notes that his pulse went up to 101 and he had overall felt "tired in his chest".  He did not take any nitroglycerine, and his symptoms promptly resolved.  He has continued to notice episodes of intermittent rapid pulses with pulses up to 100.  He has had no syncope or near syncope.  Generally, he has been walking on the treadmill up to four to six miles a day several times a week.  Over the last few weeks, he has felt a little bit more fatigued and now can only walk approximately four miles.  He has not had any sustained palpitation, syncope, or near syncope, but has noted a slight decrease in his exercise tolerance.

Selected recent labs

			

  ECG new atrial fibrillation at rate 74. Right bundle branch block, no ischemic changes



Assessment and plan

			

  The patient's symptoms and exam as well as EKG are consistent with atrial fibrillation.  Of note, the patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after his CABG.  However, he has not had any significant symptoms since that time.  He remains active without any evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.  He continues to exercise on a regular basis.  Given his slightly elevated pulse rate, his atenolol will be increased to 25 mg PO BID from one per day which is what he is currently taking.  His blood pressure is under good control.  Given his recent episode of repeat stress test will be sent.  If there is any prolonged episode of pain, he will come to the emergency room immediately.  He is encouraged to use nitroglycerine sublingually if he has any evidence or any chest pressure.  For his diabetes, his labs will be sent.  He remains on Coumadin for anticoagulation, and his INR has been therapeutic.  He will follow up in three months but sooner pending the above evaluation.  If he has any increase in his symptoms, he will be admitted immediately.
