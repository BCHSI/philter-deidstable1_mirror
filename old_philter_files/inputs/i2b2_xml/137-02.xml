HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old white male who comes to the office for reevaluation regarding his diabetes.  He also has high blood pressure and coronary artery disease.


Diabetes.  The patient is trying to adhere to his diet.  He stays on his usual medicines, which include Glucophage and glyburide.  He takes an aspirin regularly and he is on his blood pressure medicines.  He does not smoke.  He follows closely his foot regimen and had not noticed any difficulty.  He sees a foot doctor.  He has not seen an eye doctor recently.  He has not been to the Jay Hospital for his routine followup and says he will start setting up appointments with the diabetes group out in Littleton, Wisconsin where he lives.  The patient specifically denies any increased thirst or urination.  His blood sugars taken at home are approximately 140-160 on a fasting basis.  He has not had any episodes of hypoglycemia.


Coronary artery disease.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Garza.  He does stay on his Plavix and aspirin and also is on other medicines including atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, Norvasc, Vasotec and he has not needed any nitroglycerin.  He still does complain of some nonspecific chest type discomfort for which he was evaluated by Dr. Garza last spring.  He had a cardiac catheterization.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Showed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure taken by me 132/76, pulse 72 and weight 206 pounds.  Skin was moist and warm without any specific lesions.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.  Neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.  No bruits were heard.  Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.  S1, S2 were normal.  Abdomen was soft, no liver or spleen was felt.  Chest wall without any pain secondary to his prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Extremities showed pulses to be satisfactory.  His feet were warm.  There was no sign of infection.  Neurologic, well oriented.  Light touch was found easily in his feet.


IMPRESSION:  Overall, the patient is satisfied with his health.  He has followup appointment with the cardiologist and needs to follow up with the eye doctor as well.  He will set up a diabetes follow up at the Rappahannock Medical Clinic.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diabetes mellitus, on oral hypoglycemic medicines, will recheck his hemoglobin A1c, recheck his urine and urine for protein.
