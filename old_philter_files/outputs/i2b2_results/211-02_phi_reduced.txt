Worthington Internal Medicine **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Re **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** # **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** **PHI** had the pleasure of seeing Mr. **PHI** **PHI** in Cardiology Clinic today . As you know , Mr. **PHI** is a very pleasant 50 year old gentleman who on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** , while sitting at a concert in **PHI** **PHI** had the sudden onset of feeling unwell , epigastric discomfort , and profound diaphoresis . He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time . By the time he arrived , his symptoms had abated . He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers , and was admitted to the medicine service to rule out a myocardial infarction . That evening , he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia , which appears to be ventricular tachycardia . He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management . The next morning , he underwent cardiac ultrasound , which revealed an ejection fraction of 28 % and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall . Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive . He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non obstructive disease of the left system . This artery was stented with total of three stents ( two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one **PHI** stent 2.5 x 28 mm ), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery . A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30 % with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall . He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0 . A follow up echocardiogram was performed on **PHI** **PHI** , **PHI** . This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36 %; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic . His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease . Because of this , a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies , normal thyroid function , and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern . He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient . Since his myocardial infarction , Mr. **PHI** has been feeling quite well . He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager . He has had no symptoms of angina , dyspnea , nausea , or diaphoresis . He has felt very well . He continues to take his medications without difficulty , and denies any symptomatology whatsoever . His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care . Of note , he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia , he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort . He was evaluated and released . He never had any further testing . He did not have a stress test , cardiac ultrasound or catheterization . Prior to his admission , he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia , but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital . His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Lipitor 20 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day . He has no known drug allergies . Ms. **PHI** is originally from Nicaragua but after working for **PHI** , Inc , he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a **PHI** **PHI** and in various other positions . He immigrated to America about a year or so ago . He has been working in Borders . He currently lives in Toledo , Montana , with his wife . He has no children . He smoked 1 to 1 **PHIDate** packs per day for about 30 years , but has not smoked since his hospitalization . He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use . He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease . On physical exam , his blood pressure was 130 82 mmHg in his right arm and 126 80 mmHg in his left arm . His heart rate is 60 and regular . In general , he is in no apparent distress . His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water . His chest is clear to auscultation without rales , wheezes , or rhonchi . His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2 . He has no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . His abdomen is benign . His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits . His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits . His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization . The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse . His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout . His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg dl , LDL of 153 mg dl , and HDL of 45mg dl . His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm . He has T wave inversions in III and aVF , and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis . Mr. **PHI** underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday . He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS , and a peak double product of 21,600 . His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia . His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction . There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere . His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51 %. In short , Mr. **PHI** is a 51 year old who had an inferior myocardial infarction , but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease . Also , his systolic function has improved over time . I think there are two processes going on . One is coronary artery disease . Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery , which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting . The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease . Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction , I can only speculate as to the etiology of this . He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy , but a transient one . I suspect that this is myocarditis . **PHI** , I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit . It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome . From the aspect of his coronary artery disease , he will continue on aspirin for life . He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery , and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months . For his hyperlipidemia , I agree with Lipitor , and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate . His LDL goal will be less than 100 . He is well beta blocked on his carvedilol , and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily . His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily . I will see Mr. **PHI** again in three months for followup . I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months ' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out . Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman . The patient was seen and examined , and the case was discussed with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . Sincerely , **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** FI **PHI** DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate**
