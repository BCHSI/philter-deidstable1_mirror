MRN:     4097229



This patient reports approximately 3-4 years ago he had episodes of right sided

visual loss.  He thought it was only related to his right eye.  What he describes is a

right peripheral hemispheric visual loss.  He reports having a history of headaches

in the past.  It is nothing that is significantly worse than usual.  On Thursday he

reports having a mild bitemporal headache and then later that day ensuing right

peripheral loss that has lasted for the past 3-4 days.  In the past his visual loss only

lasted for about one day.  He denies any other focal neurological complaints.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  He is on a baby aspirin a day.  He

denies any further headaches.  He denies any numbness, tingling or weakness on

one side of his body or other.  He has chronic left knee problems from an old

injury.  He is unable to bend the leg.  He has no new problems with his gait.  He

denies any symptoms of jaw claudication.  



PHYSICAL EXAM:  His exam reveals no temporal artery tenderness to palpation. 

His funduscopic exam appears normal on undilated exam.  His visual fields reveals

what appears to be consistent with right bilateral hemianopsia.  PERRLA.  EOMI. 

Cranial nerves II-XII are otherwise intact.  His motor strength is 5/5.  He has no

pronator drift.  His cerebellar exam is intact.  His blood pressure is 150/100.

Carotid - no bruit.  Cor - RRR no MGR Lungs - CTA

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Question bilateral hemianopsia.  The patient will get

scheduled for an MRI/MRA as soon as possible.  He was sent to the NDMG
Ophthalmology Clinic to confirm bilateral vs. unilateral hemianopsia (central vs. peripheral etiology) today for further evaluation plus/minus ESR and CBC at

that point in time.
