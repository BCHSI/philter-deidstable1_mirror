 Record date **PHI** CARDIOLOGY OAKLAND ASSOCIATES CENTER Reason for visit s p Left SFA intervention Interval History Mr. **PHI** is a 64 y.o . male who presented to Dr **PHI** 's office on **PHIDate** with left foot pain with claudication at approximately 20 feet , L & gt ; R , and constant left great toe pain . He has intermittent b l buttock . Found it difficult to walk from the entrance to the Cath lab today . He describes upon awakening with paresthesias which resolves with ambulation . He does not exercise but is active during the day . He also c o chest discomfort starting last week with palpitations associated with lightheaded . He was resting at the time . He took sl TNG without any improvement . This has occured 2 3 times . He denies sob , n v , diaphoresis , syncope . CTA RUN on **PHIDate** showed multilevel disease involving both **PHI** . Right focal area of mild to moderate ISR . Left severe focal stenosis of the SFA proximal to the proximal stent and severe focal in stent stenosis within the distal stent . One vessel runoff bilaterally via the peroneal arteries . AVF in the right groin . An Adenosine MIBI was performed on **PHIDate** . Exercised with arm exercises for 4 ' 0 '', reaching 62 % of **PHI** . EKG negative for ischemia . Images show small territory of mild septal ischemia , EF 46 %. Compared to **PHIDate** ( done w exercise as opposed to adenosine ) the anterior and apical ischemia is no longer evident and the EF is similar 49 %. Today he underwent coronary angiography which revealed no change from prior cath . Peripheral angiogram noted aorta and renal arteries were patent . Left and right common and external iliac arteries patent . Stent at the origin of the right ext iliac had a 30 % diffuse narrowing . Bilateral internal iliac arteries have moderately severe stenoses in the distal aspect of main branches . The left SFA has two areas of tapered stenosis up to 70 % one is proximal and the other is midvessel ; main popliteal is patent , but focal 75 % stenosis present at distal portion prior to trifurcation . Anterior and posterial tibial vessels occluded and reconstitute at the ankle by collaterals from the peroneal . The peroneal has calcified 60 % diffuse disease in the proximal segment . He therefore underwent PTA of the proximal SFA , PTA and stent to the mid SFA , DCA and PTA of distal popliteal lesion , fox hollow and PTA of proximal peroneal stenosis . He is presently being admitted to Cardiology post intervention . Past medical history 1 . Coronary artery disease . Cath **PHIDate** showed 3 vessel CAD with involvement of distal coronary circulation . All vessels narrow in caliber . LM distal 30 %, LAD diffuse proximal plaque and occluded after large diagonal . Faint collaterals supply distal LAD and septals ,. Diagonal patent , Lcx 50 % ostial stenosis then 50 60 % irregular stenosis in proximal aspect of AV groove artery after OM1 take off . OM1 patent . Diffuse **PHI** in Lcx and Om . RCA diffuse plaquing in dominant vessel , narrow up to 35 %. EF 65 % with mild apical HK . 2 . PVD Stent to right external iliac , 30 % narrowing . PTA to SFA , stent to mid SFA , directional arthrectomy and PTA of distal popliteal lesion , fox hollow PTA or proximal peroneal stenosis . Angiogram **PHIDate** Peripheral artery disease . **PHI** iliac vessels patent . Left Common iliac 40 % plaque distally . Left internal iliac **PHI** , left external iliac patent , left CFA calcified plaque w 40 % stenosis . Left SFA 40 % focal proximal , then 50 60 % mid and 70 % stenosis proximal to and into prior . Adductor canal stent , 70 % at egress of stent . Left popliteal patent . Peroneal patent but AT and PT occluded . TPT 70 % tapered . Right common and external **PHI** patent , internal iliac distal stenosis of 60 70 % at complex trifurcation . Right CFA narrowed 50 % by plaque . Right SFA and popliteal diffuse plaque deposition , patent . **PHI** balloon **PHI** left distal ( within and above prior stent ) and mid SFA . Stent 7 x 30 mm Precise in distal SFA overlapping w proximal aspect of prior stent , 7 x 20 mm Exceed in mid SFA in site of **PHI** where there remained a narrowing and dissection . Post dilation of both sites with balloon . PTA and stent 2.5 x 28 Cypher in TP trunk . Widely patent to ankle . Patent renal arteries 3 . Hypertension . 4 . Hyperlipidemia . 5 . Type 2 diabetes . 6 . Left ulnar transposition and left ulnar nerve compression , with prior surgery on **PHIDate** . 7 . Ulcerative colitis diagnosed 30 years ago , on medication for a short time . Episode 10 15 years ago controlled with meds . In the last 2 years he has had increased problems and has been hospitalized . He has never had surgery . His last **PHI** was 3 months ago . 8 .

Found to have same coronary anatomy earlier today on angiography . Peripheral angiography noted above stenosis for which he underwent noted interventions . Plan will be for ASA and plavix x 3 months or more with plan for discharge in the morning . He should follow up with **PHI** **PHI** PA in 6 8 weeks with exercise ABI 's and duplex SFA and proximal **PHI** distal popliteal . He continues to have tenderness to palpation over left DIP joint which may be consistent with reperfusion issues .
