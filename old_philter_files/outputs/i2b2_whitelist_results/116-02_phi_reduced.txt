As you know , Mr. **PHI** underwent a left femoral to posterior tibial bypass one month ago followed by amputation of a gangrenous first toe . After being discharged from our service he was **PHI** to the Medical Service with a severe case of C. difficile colitis . Ultimately this resolved and he was discharged . Today he reports that the diarrhea has again **PHI** and he was placed back on an oral antibiotic yesterday . He complains of only mild incisional discomfort in his left leg . On examination , there is a **PHI** pulse easily palpated over the left lower extremity bypass graft . The old right lower extremity bypass graft was also palpable . The left foot itself is warm . The great toe incision site , however , has developed necrotic tissue all along the incision , which was sharply **PHI** to clean margins . This will now need to be treated as an open wound . The calf portion of the left lower extremity incision also has a narrow zone of superficial skin slough which was gently **PHI** . The graft is not exposed and there are no deep wounds in the leg . Mr. **PHI** 's left lower extremity bypass graft is functioning well . However , he will require significant ongoing wound care for the immediate future . Daily dressing changes will be arranged with visiting nurse services . We plan to follow him closely and an appointment was given for two **PHI** . Thanks again for allowing us to participate in the care of this delightful and challenging patient and please do n't hesitate to contact me at any time if I can RE : **PHI** , Earnest MRN : **PHI** **PHI** Page **PHI** be of further assistance .
