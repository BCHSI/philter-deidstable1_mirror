She was doing well until **PHI** **PHI** , when she presented with a non healing ulcer and gangrene in her L third toe and subsequently underwent a redo L fem anterior tibial bypass using R basilic and cephalic veins on **PHIDate** . On **PHIDate** she had graft scanning , which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and ankle brachial indices at that time were normal bilaterally . However , she presented on **PHIDate** c o L foot pain . On physical exam , she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe . She now presents with increasing pain ,&# 8220 ; 32 &# 8221 ; on scale 0 10 that is constant in nature , with occasional sharp spikes in intensity .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 52 y o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD , s p several bypasses , presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration . On physical exam , L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch , it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe . In addition , ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19 . The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy , however , she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely . oxycodone for pain control , continue neurontin continue home atenolol , ASA , Valsartan NPO from midnight , pepcid check **PHI** , CBC , coags has an insulin pump angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** IV **PHI** Patient seen and examined .
