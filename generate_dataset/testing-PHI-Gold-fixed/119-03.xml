NAME:    Curtis, Om 
MRN:     7682941
   
He is feeling great.  He is all done with his radiation to the left axilla for metastatic
squamous cell cancer.  He is following closely with the radiation oncologist and the
medical oncologist.  He is seeing them both later this month.  He has had no
problems with chest pains or shortness of breath.  All in all, things are going well.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, no acute distress.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  He does have some skin
discoloration around the left axilla but I feel no mass.  He has a well-healed incision. 
There is no hair noted in or around the axilla.  Extremities with no edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  CAD/hypertension/diabetes mellitus.  This is stable.  Check glycosylated
     hemoglobin. 

(2)  Metastatic squamous cell cancer.  He is being followed closely by Oncology for
     this.  Follow-up with me in the spring.
