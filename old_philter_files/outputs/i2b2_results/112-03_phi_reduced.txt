 Record date **PHI** **PHI** , CLARENCE **PHI** **PHIDate** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** Internal Medicine **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** **PHI** had the pleasure of seeing Mr. **PHI** in followup in Cardiology today . As you know , he is a 54 year old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on **PHIDate** for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring . His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and asthma . Prior to his pacemaker placement , an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain . He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds . The test was terminated for **PHIDate** substernal chest pain , but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted . We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. **PHI** has done well since that time . He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved . However , he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort . He tells me that he underwent testing at **PHI** Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality , though the report of this test is not available to me today for review . Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction . The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months . The atrial impedance is 544 **PHI** and the ventricular impedance is 519 **PHI** . The P wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R wave in the ventricle is 31 mV . The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec , and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec . In summary , the pacemaker appears to be working quite well . However , Mr. **PHI** persists in a **PHI** sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation . I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia . In addition , I have performed a 12 lead ECG , which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia . Today in the office , his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure . Mr. **PHI** and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable . I have discussed this case with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. **PHI** in the near future , since Dr. **PHI** is moving his practice to the **PHI** . I plan to see Mr. **PHI** in followup in three months ' time for his pacemaker . If any issues arise in the interim , please do not hesitate to contact me . Sincerely , Una **PHI** , MD eScription document **PHI** **PHI** transcriptionists DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
