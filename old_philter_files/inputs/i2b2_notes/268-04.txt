INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

HOLDEN DISTRICT HOSPITAL



Reason for visit

			

  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.



History of present illness

			

  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.  Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.  He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.  At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.  He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.  He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.  He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.  He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.  He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.  He is here for a followup.  Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.  His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.

Assessment and plan

			

  The patient's multiple issues were reviewed with the patient in detail.  His weight has remained fairly stable on the lower dose of diuretics, and a repeat BUN and creatinine were sent today.  He was volume depleted at his last visit.  Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.  His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.  His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.  His weight control has been a problem.  He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.  He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.
