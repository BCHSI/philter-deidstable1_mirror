 Record date : **PHI** July **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** Light , M.D . Internal Medicine **PHI** Memorial Hospital RE : **PHI** **PHI** MR # **PHI** Dear **PHI** : Mrs. **PHI** presents to the office today for general cardiac evaluation . As her history is well known to you , I will repeat it briefly for our records . Mrs. **PHI** is a **PHI** woman with a history of variegata porphyria , insulin dependent diabetes and significant coronary artery disease . In **PHI** , after a four to five day history of retrosternal chest discomfort , she was admitted to the **PHI** Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography revealed a **PHI** % proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis . She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with inadequate results . She therefore was taken electively for coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to her LAD . She subsequently continued to have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of **PHI** at which time coronary angiography revealed a **PHI** % stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a **PHI** % stenosis in the mid right coronary artery . The catheterization report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary artery graft . Since then , she has continued to have episodes of intermittent abdominal discomfort . She recently has undergone an extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered . Trials of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective . In November of **PHI** , she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of **PHI** , peak blood pressure of **PHI** stopping because of fatigue . She had no ischemic changes on electrocardiogram . Over the past two **PHI** however , she has **PHI** that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome ( which she often describes as feeling like indigestion ) now includes radiation to her left shoulder . The pain is not exacerbated by position , time of day or any particular activity . The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest . Of note , her lipid profile from October **PHI** indicates a cholesterol of **PHI** , triglyceride of **PHI** , HDL **PHI** , LDL of **PHI** . **PHI** , **PHI** MR # **PHI** **PHI** July **PHI** , **PHI** Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria , insulin dependent diabetes , right hand carpal tunnel syndrome , Dupuytren's contracture and tendinitis and hypertension . Medications at Present : Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., NPH insulin **PHI** units sub q qAM , **PHI** **PHI** units sub q qAM . Allergies : None . Cigarettes - none . Ethanol - social . Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma , mother dying of colon cancer , question coronary disease , one brother having a myocardial infarction at age **PHI** , another brother dying from melanoma age **PHI** . The rest of her siblings and children have not heart disease . Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress . Blood pressure right arm sitting **PHI** , heart rate **PHI** and regular , respirations **PHI** and unlabored , weight **PHI** pounds . The neck is supple . JVP flat . Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right greater than left **PHI** . Chest is clear . Cardiac exam shows a normal S1 , physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base , no significant diastolic murmur . The abdomen is benign . Extremities reveal no appreciable edema . Peripheral pulses are intact . Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of **PHI** . PR interval of **PHI** , QRS **PHI** , QT **PHI** , axis **PHI** degrees . There are minor nonspecific **PHI** wave changes . Impression : Mrs. **PHI** is a **PHI** woman with a history of variegata porphyria , insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension and dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease . She has had a retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show significant provokable ischemia . Nonetheless , I am concerned that her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia . I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive studies . In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin dependent diabetes , I strongly recommend beginning aggressive antilipemic pharmacologic therapy . Unless her variegata porphyria **PHI** the use of atorvastatin , I would begin this at **PHI** mg po q.d . I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than **PHI** . In addition , I have started her on atenolol at **PHI** mg po q.d . and I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her porphyria does not **PHI** , **PHI** MR # **PHI** **PHI** July **PHI** , **PHI** preclude this . She understands that if she has evidence for significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her to undergo repeat coronary angiography . Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care . Sincerely yours , **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
