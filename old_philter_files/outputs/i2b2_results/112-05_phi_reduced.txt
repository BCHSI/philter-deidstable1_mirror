 Record date **PHI** **PHI** , CLARENCE **PHI** **PHIDate** HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS He has not had recurrent angina . Unfortunately , we did not connect back in **PHI** following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation . We had left a message with his daughter , **PHI** . Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2 %. He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital . He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido . MEDICATIONS His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily , ezetimibe 10 mg daily , Ecotrin 325 mg daily , Prilosec 20 mg daily . He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription . It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION His heart rate at rest is 105 . His initial blood pressure 149 96 , but then 150 82 on repeat , using a large cuff . His weight is down 4 pounds to 193 . His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal . His lung fields are clear . He has no cardiac murmur . There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema . His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia ( after rushing into the office ) and an incomplete right bundle branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration . In comparison with his tracing from **PHIDate** , his resting heart rate has increased . ASSESSMENT AND PLAN He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps . It is possible that the higher dose beta blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction , though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether . We will refer him to the practice of Dr. **PHI** and Dr. **PHI** , as well as to Dr. **PHI** , the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction . He will continue his efforts at weight loss . He is working out at the gym 2 3 times per week . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . eScription document **PHI** **PHI** DD **PHIDate** DT **PHIDate** DV **PHIDate**
