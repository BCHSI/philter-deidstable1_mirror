HPI: Asked to see patient by surgical team in consultation for is multiple medical issues. I have served as his PCP for eight years. Pt seen and examined. Case discussed in detail . This is a 62 y/o male with multiple medical issues last admitted in September for increased falls, found to have a small stroke in addition to his likely vascular dementia. Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer/ S/P debridement and later TMA. He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow-up. At baseline, patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy, has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25% compliance. At the time of his last admission, he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement.


The patient's wound has currently not been closed. He has a vac dressing in place. He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology. Current hospital course has been complicated by increased agitation and last evening, self limited substernal chest pain and dyspnea. This resolved spontaneously. He has also been intermittently refusing his medications and has been attempting to ambulate.


This AM.  the patient actually denies ever experiencing chest pain. He also only recalls his foot pain with repeated prompting. He denies any pain, dyspnea


ROS otherwise negative.,

EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.


Assessment/Plan
 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes. Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial. S/P Rt TMA. Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.


By issue:


1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance. The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management. If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option. In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.


Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx. I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.  If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.


2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start. He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes. Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx. Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior. Might hold ranitidine as well.  Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc. Currently on olanzapine. Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged. Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.


3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound. Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status. All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative. Would seek ID input to the end. Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future. 
4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today . Recs per nephrology
3) DM: HgA1c was at target. Please cover as needed with RISS for now. 5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time. Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP. Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
 Thanks,
