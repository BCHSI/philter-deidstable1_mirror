 Record date : **PHI** Team A Intern Admit Note Patient Name : **PHI** **PHI** MR # **PHI** Date of Admission : **PHI** Attending : **PHI** **PHI** PCP : **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** : **PHI** yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture **PHI** **PHI** , admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status HPI :( As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes , pt is not able to give history and family is not present .) Ms. **PHI** is somewhat cognitively and **PHI** impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm **PHI** **PHI** ; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy , clot evacuation , and placement for a VP shunt . She was transferred to **PHI** County Clinic **PHI** , and was d/c 'd **PHI** . Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow **PHI** step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication . She gets nutrition and medication through a **PHI** at this point , and has had an indwelling foley catheter . Computer notes suggest that prior to **PHI** **PHI** , the indwelling foley catheter had been removed . However , the patient 's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry , the notes suggest that the foley was replaced **PHI** . **PHI** Ms. **PHI** was taken to the emergency room ; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear . U/A was suggestive of a UTI , and she was treated with a **PHI** course of levofloxacin . There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time , and urine cultures were not sent . Telephone notes from **PHI** suggest that Ms. **PHI** had yeast infection and foley blockage ; **PHI** the VNA checked a U/A at home ; results were consistent with a UTI . Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and less herself over the last few days . She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation . In the ED , repeat U/A was consistent with UTI ; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus . She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor . PMH :( Per chart- pt unable to provide history ) **PHI** . S/P aneurysm rupture , suboccipital craniotomy for microsurgical trapping and clipping of distal PICA aneurysm , and evacuation of 4th ventricular clot . **PHI** .

Head CT : **PHI** . No significant change compared to prior CT **PHI** . No change in ventricle size . No acute infarct ; although , this is better assessed with MR with diffusion . **PHI** . Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup . EKG : Normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , normal intervals . Flattened **PHI** , but not changed from prior exam . No evidence of acute ischemia . Impression : **PHI** yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function , admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status . Mental status changes : given likely **PHI** UTI **PHI** , pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source . Important to rule out **PHI** complication as cause of mental status **PHI** , but CT appears unchanged from **PHI** . Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat to mental status changes . -will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures -will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes , particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism UTI -likely UTI- tx -will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source -unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen , but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back , then treat with appropriate antibiotic -treat with **PHI** for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data -change foley now **PHI** u/a and culture after **PHI** days of antibiotics Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status -volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic , likely hypovolemic hyponatremia . If **PHI** , likely SIADH , which could be caused by neurologic process , pain , or infection -given difficulty assessing volume status , will send urine for sodium and osm . If low sodium high osm , likely hypovolemic . If higher sodium , more likely SIADH . DM -will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose , checking TSH **PHI** ranitidine BID , glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary **PHI** home medications wound care consult requested for report of decubitus ulcer **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** MD # **PHI**
