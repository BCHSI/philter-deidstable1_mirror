 Record date **PHI** Results **PHI** GLU POC 159 (*) **PHI** GLU POC 112 **PHI** HGBA1C 7.8 (*) Spanish **PHI** **PHI** **PHI**, NH **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr. **PHI** is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago. He left **PHI** after I saw him in **PHI** when he was free of angina. While taking an afternoon walk in **PHI** during early **PHI** he experienced fairly severe mid sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated to the left upper arm and patient discribed it as "sharp burning pressure". He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED. An EKG was "normal" and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On **PHI** he was catheterized and found to have "diffuse CAD" involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on **PHI**, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on **PHI** on the following medication ASA 81 mg Plavix 75 mg po qd Bisoprolol 5mg po qd Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1 2 po in pm Ranitidine 300 mg po qd Lipitor 40 mg po qd A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs Metformin 1000 mg po bid Mr. **PHI** has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was was read as not suggestive of ischemia Testing performed STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER M Mode 2D Quality Conclusion 1. Patient exercised 6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol, reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue. No chest pain was reported. Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154 68. The maximum rate pressure product was 18,942.2. See exercise report for full ECG details. Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm. There were 1 mm horizontal upsloping ST depressions in leads V3 6 and lead II at peak exercise.3. Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals Normal left ventricular size and systolic function. Estimated resting ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion abnormalities. Trace mitral regurgitation.4. Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise reveal Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection fraction of &gt;80%. All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion abnormalities.SUMMARY No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF **PHI**,M.D.,PH.D. Mr. **PHI** has Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in **PHI**. At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina. Glycemic control ahs been variable. Last HGBA1C in **PHI** was 7.8. Lately there has been an increase in fating levels. Today BG 162. Last week 112 at home. He is no longer exercising. Has nocturia X2 but without dysuria. Denies polyuria, polydipsia, nause, chills and fever. Appetite normal. He has residual right shoulder pain after a fall in **PHI** which was significantly improved by steroid injections. Episode of bilateral low pitched ringing in his ears has abated. Uses two pillows. No PND, orthopnea and leg edema. Denies vision changes. . Denies episodes of light headedness or vertigo. PMHx H O diabetes mellitus type 2 h o poorly controlled diabetes, which improved and then deteriorated. Cataracts. He was seen by Ophthalmology and was told insurance does not cover cataract surgery which he needs. Vital Signs BP 125 65, P 64, Temp 95.7 F, Wt 144 lb GEN well appearing, thin elderly gentleman HEENT Hazing of left lens, no arcus senilis. PERRLA CARD nl S1, S2. No m r g. JVP &lt;5cm. RESP CTAB Abdomen soft, normal BS, No hepatomegaly, no masses. EXT WWP. Pedal pulses 2+ bilaterally. No evidence of foot ulcers or calluses , multiple varicose veins. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN A 78 year old gentleman with a history of adult onset diabetes and CVA who has new onset of exertional angina who was catheterized in **PHI** 2 weeks ago. Findings difuse, severe multi vessel disease weith well preserved LVF. LAD Critical stenosis 95% at origen and bad distal bed LCX obstructed disttally Good marginal obtuse branch with 90% stenosis med proximal RCA Normal origen difuse disease 75 80% stenosis. Plan Consult Cardiology ASAP meanwhile check BP, Lipids, CBC, TSH, MA and alt ast. Nitroglycerine prescription renewed. Continue present regimen. Patient instructed to call and come to ED if he experiences CP. However he lives in **PHI** and driving in can take some time. **PHI**, M.D. Health Maintenance Cholesterol HDL **PHI** 44 Cholesterol LDL **PHI** 101 Cholesterol **PHI** 167 GFR (estimated) **PHI** 67 (Abnormal if &lt;60 mL min 1.73m2If patient is black, multiply by 1.21) HbA1c **PHI** 9.2 Hct (Hematocrit) **PHI** 39.3 Hgb (Hemoglobin) **PHI** 13.8 Influenza Vaccine **PHI** Manufaturer SanDisk M alb creat ratio **PHI** 3.7 Units  =  mg Alb g Cre Microalbumin **PHI** 0.5 Pneumovax **PHI** expiration **PHI** PSA **PHI** 0.9 Triglycerides **PHI** 111 TSH **PHI** 2.240 UA Protein **PHI** NEG Immunization Influenza Vaccine **PHI** Pneumovax **PHI**
