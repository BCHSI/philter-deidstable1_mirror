 Record date : **PHI** Thyroid Division **PHI** Memorial Hospital **PHI** **PHI** St Sioux City , FL **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** MR # **PHI** November **PHI** , **PHI** This is the first visit for Ms. **PHI** who is a **PHI** year old woman who presents for management of papillary thyroid cancer . Her symptoms began in May , **PHI** , when she felt a prominence in her neck . She did not experience any dysphagia or voice changes , but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid examination . She underwent a thyroid biopsy in **PHI** , **PHI** , at a local hospital . The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma . She was subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent thyroidectomy on **PHI** . The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then reimplanted . According to the operative report , the carcinoma was felt to be locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present . The pathology revealed a ( R ) **PHI** cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and **PHI** invasion . There was an additional focus of papillary carcinoma , follicular variant , in the ( L ) thyroid lobe that was **PHI** cm . Of note , the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative . The tumor did stain positively for thyroglobulin . Since undergoing thyroidectomy , Ms. **PHI** has done fairly well . She has been maintained on **PHI** mcg daily of Levoxyl . She says that she feels generally well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue . She denies any changes in her sleep , hair , skin or bowels . She does endorse a one pound weight gain over the last two months . She denies any paresthesias or other symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia . She denies any history of thyroid disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer . She is now referred for consideration of radioiodine ablation . Past Medical History : Notable for congestive heart failure . She has an ejection fraction of **PHI** %. She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , and anxiety . No history of childhood irradiation . Current Medications : Digoxin **PHI** daily ; Coreg **PHI** mg daily ; Levoxyl **PHI** mcg daily ; Lipitor **PHI** mg daily ; Coumadin **PHI** mg daily ; Lasix **PHI** mg daily ; captopril **PHI** mg , tid ; labetolol **PHI** , bid ; nitroglycerine . Allergies : No known drug allergies . Social History : Remote history of tobacco . She quit **PHI** years ago . She **PHI** rare alcohol use . She is married with four children . Family History : Negative for thyroid cancer . Physical Exam : Blood pressure is elevated at **PHI** . Weight **PHI** . Pulse **PHI** . In general this is a somewhat tired , slightly **PHI** woman in NAD . HEENT : PERRLA . EOMI . No proptosis or lid lag . Neck : supple with a large **PHI** thyroidectomy scar . No **PHI** **PHI** MR # **PHI** November **PHI** , **PHI** Page **PHI** remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated . Lungs : clear to auscultation bilaterally . Cardiovascular : normal S1 , S2 , regular rate and rhythm . Abdomen : soft , slightly distended , non-tender , moderately obese . Extremities : trace pedal edema , 1+ distal pulses . Neurologic : reflexes are slightly delayed . There is no tremor of outstretched hands . Review of Labs : Of note , include a TSH of **PHI** from **PHI** , **PHI** , that was prior to surgery . Free T4 at that time was normal at **PHI** . Calcium prior to surgery was slightly elevated at **PHI** though several **PHI** drawn after her surgery were in the **PHI** range . Impression : This is a **PHI** year old woman with a history of congestive heart failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer . Ms. **PHI** is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is older at the time of diagnosis , she had a **PHI** tumor , and she had multifocal disease . Plan : Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline . We suspect that she may be **PHI** on her current dose of Levoxyl . I have recommended **PHI** treatment . Benefits and risks were discussed . In addition , I think she would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal . TSH and calcium were drawn today . We will plan to arrange for **PHI** for January .
