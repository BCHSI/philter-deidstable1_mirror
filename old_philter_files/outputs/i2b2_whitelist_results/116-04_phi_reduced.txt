 Record date : **PHI** March **PHI** , **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Integra Health Center Derry Street La **PHI** , ME **PHI** RE : Branch , Earnest **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** : Your patient Earnest Branch came in the office today for a follow up visit . Mr. Branch is now two years out from a right femoral- tibial bypass and nine months out from a left **PHI** bypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot and **PHI** skin grafting . Over the last several months , he has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining , small , superficial , open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot . Over the last one to two **PHI** , he began to note the development of a new area of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and recently has noted some drainage . He denies any fevers . In addition and of note , he complains of recent onset of pain in the right eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic immediately following his visit with us . He last underwent vascular lab studies in September at which time both lower extremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses . On examination today , there are **PHI** , easily palpable pulses over both lower extremity bypass grafts . The right foot is warm and without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions . On examination of the left foot , there is a large area of full- thickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where there had never been any previous open wounds . This area **PHI** a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the foot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal mid foot . On probing , purulent material drains from the margins and there is obvious significant sepsis . The foot itself is warm and there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle . Unfortunately , Mr. Branch has developed a new , large wound on the left foot which likely began as a pressure ( decubitus ) ulceration due to his severe neuropathy . This is now complicated by significant local sepsis and there is a large area of soft tissue loss on the foot . He will require urgent admission and operative debridement today . In addition , given the extent of the problem , it is likely that he will ultimately come to **PHI** amputation in the end . Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology Clinic , he will be admitted to the RE : Branch , Earnest **PHI** **PHI** Page **PHI** hospital with the **PHI** of performing debridement and drainage later today . I will certainly continue to keep you **PHI** of his progress . Sincerely , **PHI** J. **PHI** , M.D . RH : **PHI** Not reviewed by Attending Physician
