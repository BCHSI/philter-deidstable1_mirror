Current illness began **PHI** **PHI** months ago with fatigue , dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only **PHI** **PHI** steps in a **PHI** . She finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue . She has had a cough that initially produced yellowish , `` slimy '' sputum , but more recently has been dry . She notes occasional wheezing . She also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past **PHI** **PHI** months that she attributed to `` arthritis ''. No polyuria , but has noted nocturia X2 for the past **PHI** **PHI** months . During the same period of time , has noted very dry mouth . No abdominal pain , but some difficulty with constipation for the past two **PHI** . Appetite diminished and she lost about **PHI** pounds . She noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her PCP `` cut into '' recently . She has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to `` get larger ''. She experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours , **PHI** her to come to the ER . No associated diaphoresis , nausea . Pain somewhat better with sitting up . Of note , she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years . Exam Pleasant **PHI** woman in no distress . BP **PHI** **PHI** , Pulse **PHI** , regular ; O2 sat **PHI** % on room air . Afebrile . Skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface , similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4th 5th toe . No other rashes . HEENT pale conjunctivae , anicteric . No nasal findings , no facial skin findings ( specifically , no lupus pernio ). Dry mucous membranes . Neck small , soft , mobile **PHI** cm node left anterior cervical chain . Chest inspiratory crackles at both bases . Cardiac No JVD . Regular rhythm . III VI ( I do not feel a thrill ) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium , but especially prominent at the **PHI** with radiation to the **PHI** , neck . Also heard at the apex and **PHI** to the left mid back (? same murmur ). The murmur **PHI** when she stands . No **PHI** . No rub . Abdomen soft and nontender . No spleen tip . Liver edge not palpable . Lymph nodes fullness below the left axilla , although not confident of discrete nodes . Data There is considerable testing available to us from her recent visits to the Walk In Clinic and to Dr. Utter . A CXR from **PHIDate** shows bilateral hilar adenopathy , mediastinal adenopathy , and interstitial infiltrates .

Symptomatic hypercalcemia Nocturia **PHI** Constipation Fatigue **PHI** . Prominent systolic murmur ( s ?). Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from **PHI** , but obviously , need more recent data . **PHI** . Minimally elevated troponins . Uncertain significance . **PHI** . Anemia , mildly microcytic . **PHI** . Elevated LDH . **PHI** . Renal insufficiency , likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia . **PHI** . History of hypertension . Discussion Sarcoidosis , until proven otherwise . She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis , but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission . The lung findings , systemic symptoms , hypercalcemia , anemia , abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis . Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion . She should not receive diuretics at present . **PHI** term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment . I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia , but we need definitive diagnosis first . The cardiac murmur is impressive , but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease . We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function . The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point . Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding . Suggest **PHI** . Stop HCTZ , avoid diuretics until fully volume **PHI** . **PHI** . IV normal saline . **PHI** need rates in the **PHI** **PHI** range to control her hypercalcemia acutely , but she has had this for some time , so can be conservative with fluids approach . **PHI** . Agree with check PTH , vitamin D levels . **PHI** . Follow lytes , creatinine , calcium , Hct . **PHI** . Agree with check echocardiogram . **PHI** . We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation . Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the **PHI** way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . Pager # **PHI** Internal Medicine B Attending
