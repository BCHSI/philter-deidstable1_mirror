Date of admission:  3/05/92



ID/CC:  75 yo woman hx HOCM, s/p recent myomectomy, AS, s/p carotid endarectomy p/w syncopal episode



History taken from:  patient, notes (please see Camille Dodd admission note in 12/91)



HPI: Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman with CHF, HOCM s/p MVR X 2, COPD and multiple other medical problems who was admitted following brief episode of syncope.  Per pt and her son, for the past few wks pt has been feeling tired, with some minimal weight gain and ankle swelling.  Approximately 7-10 days prior to admission, pt given azithromycin for increased cough and COPD.  In addition, 8 days prior to admission, pt's regular lasix dose was increased from 80 to 120 mg for four days, then reduced back to 80 mg.  On the night prior to admission, pt was in the kitchen, leaning on the counter top, feeling hot and tired when as she was turning to walk back to bed, she began to fall back.  Her son, who was in the room, was able to catch her before she actually fell.  He reports that she seemed awake but was not responding.  There was no sz like activity, no bowel or urinary incontinence.  Pt was out for approx 30-45 seconds when she came to.  She does not remember going down.  She denies any auras before going down, no chest pain, no palpitations, no increased SOB.  No recent fevers, abdom pain or diarrhea.  Her son called EMT and she was brought in to PHH.



ED Course:  initial vitals 140/66 78  18  98.0 .  She received an aspirin along with many of her home meds, CXR c/w pulmonary congestion.  She was eventually transferred to floor in stable condition.

CV:

-Echo 11/91:  bioprosthetic prosthetic valve in the mitral position. The valve appears well-seated.  The left atrium is dilated. There is restricted aortic leaflet opening c/w valvular aortic stenosis.  The peak trans AV gradient is 46 mmHg.  The mean trans AV gradient is 23 mmHg. The aortic valve area is 0.8 sqcm., calculated by the  continuity equation. (LVOT dimension=1.8 cm.)  (LVOT velocity=1.06 m/s.)  The peak velocity was obtained from the apical 5 chamber view.  There is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency.  The left ventricular cavity size is small.  The left  ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.  There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  The estimated ejection fraction is 55 %.

Urine cx: pending



Radiology:

CXR: No acute pulmonary consolidations.

Pulmonary vascular congestion.



EKG: ? sinus, abnormal P-waves morphology 



Impr/Plan:  75 yo woman with MVR, HOCM, severe AS who p/w following episode of syncope.



1. Syncope: hx worrisome for cardiac etiology given suddenness of the episode w/o much warning.  Likely etiologies could be some decreased pre-load in setting of recent increased diuresis, perhaps decreased po intake in a woman dependent on preload 2/2 her valvular disease.   In addion, pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate interrogating her pacer.  Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well.

--will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease, LV function, could consider stress test

--will consult EP to assess pacer function

--pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight

--will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent 

--will re-check carotid studies

--will re-start ASA (it was recently stopped) given carotid and vascular disease



2. CHF: pt carries diagnosis of CHF and CXR c/w some pulmonary congestion.  On exam, pt with crackles bilaterally also c/w pulm edema.

--will cont outpt lasix but need to be very careful given pt's tenous volume status



3. COPD: cont outpt regimen



4. FEN: normal diet, replete lytes as needed



5. proph: boots, TEDS since pt HIT positive, nexium
