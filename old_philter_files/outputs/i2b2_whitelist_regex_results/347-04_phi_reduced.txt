 Record date **PHI** **PHI** has been doing `` okay '' since our last visit ; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability . She had a video swallow at **PHI** ; she and **PHI** were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation . Her gait has been unchanged , but she still feels it has **PHI** a **PHI** over the last year . She is gardening , and trying to stay active ; she has had no falls and uses a cane . She recently added amlodipine for her hypertension . Echocardiogram Date **PHIDate** borderline LVH , preserved EF . Posterobasal HK . Not done for PFO .

She appears well overall , but slightly anxious . Cognitively , she appears unchanged ; her speech is fluent , with intact repetition and comprehension , and her recall of recent events ( **PHI** by her daughter ) is good . Pupils are equal and reactive , EOMI , **PHI** . Face , tongue and palate are symmetric , but she is dysarthric ; glottal sounds worst . This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit . Strength is full in all extremities ; her mild dysmetria is unchanged . Her walk , always wide based and slightly unsteady , appears mildly worse than our previous visit , but she is not using a cane , and is able to catch herself after mild **PHI** . She is unable to tandem gait . Impression **PHI** is a **PHI** year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation , plus diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia . She is s p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty . Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent , but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms . My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors , such as diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , as you are doing . I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen . I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than **PHI** mmHg . I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use ( **PHI** ) her clinical status , and ( **PHI** ) 'functional ' imaging , such as Diamox SPECT , to follow her cerebrovascular disease . I think intervention would be **PHI** if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters . I have not yet heard from **PHI** **PHI** about his thoughts regarding the recent scan , but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology . Our impression is that , while the **PHI** of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis , it 's not significant enough to prompt us to act , in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes . I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan , since the previous one was in **PHI** of last year . This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH ; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year . While I can be available for questions or concerns , I will be referring **PHI** 's care to one of the more junior residents . **PHI** **PHI** MD , **PHI** BMH Neurology
