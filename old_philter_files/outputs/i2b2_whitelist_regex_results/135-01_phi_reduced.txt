Of note , her and her son note increasing DOE for the past **PHI** months and she was scheduled for outpatient TTE today . She also reports DOE and productive cough with **PHI** yellow sputum that has been blood tinged ever since her EGD on **PHIDate** . She also notes recent URI symptoms especially runny nose as well as diarrhea the day PTA with **PHI** loose BMs . On the day prior to admission , she had **PHI** sweats but did n't take her temperature . She has also had decreased po intake ( though improved w treatment for her trigeminal neuralgia ) but denies F C CP abd pain dysuria . Her symptoms acutely worsened today such that she was in acute respiratory distress and EMS was called.. EMS was called and the patient was noted to initially be speaking in full sentences but became more acutely SOB in the ambulance . In the ED , she was afebrile but tachycardic to **PHI** and hypertensive at **PHI** **PHI** . She initially required bipap with O2 sats of **PHI** %. She was given prednisone , Levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms . Of note , she was also noted to have mild ST changes on her EKG while she was tachycardic to the **PHI** . She received ASA , Lopressor and Ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated CK and CK MB but negative troponin at **PHI** . Her EKG improved with rate control w IV Lopressor . She was also given 30mg IV Lasix given some mild LE edema to which she put out **PHI** urine . She is now admitted to the floor for further management of her SOB . ROS No F C ,+ NS .

No slurring of speech , unilateral weakness . No dysuria . Hospital Course Patient had TTE performed on **PHIDate** which showed increase trans mitral valve gradient . Given patient 's history of MVR , TEE was recommended . On the night of **PHIDate** , patient ( who was known to sundown ) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head . No change in MS . In the setting of being on coumadin , patient had a stat CT of the head done which was negative for bleeds . On **PHIDate** , patient went down for a TEE but **PHI** to **PHI** and the procedure was aborted . Dr. Janssen then decided to perform cardiac cath on the patient Saturday **PHIDate** . On **PHIDate** , decision was made to put her on BIPAP for the night , and the patient did well and felt **PHI** the next morning . On **PHIDate** , because patient looked so well , she was not put on BIPAP but rather only on **PHI** for the night . This AM , patient 's respiratory status declined **PHI** in the low **PHI** while on O2 **PHI** . ABG was performed which showed **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** .
