CHEST CT **PHI** : Pericardial effusion has resolved without apparent change in bilateral pleural effusions since **PHI** . Prior granulomatous infection is evident . TTE : The left ventricle is normal in size . Overall left ventricular function is mildly to moderately reduced . The estimated ejection fraction is **PHI** %. There is global hypokinesis with regional variation . There is septal ? bounce ? raising the possibility of constrictive physiology . IMPRESSION & amp ; RECOMMENDATIONS : **PHI** with h/o NHL in remission , secondary MDS s/p non **PHI** allo BMT now off all immune suppression since **PHI** presenting with fevers , SOB , and malaise . He has not yet had documented fevers in the hospital , but his rhinorrhea after sick contact during this season is suggestive of a viral syndrome . He has chronically mildly elevated LFTs which are stable . He has a new mild **PHI** of unclear etiology . -nasopharyngeal swab AND pertussis **PHI** for pertussis given persistent cough and low grade **PHI** -f/u respiratory viral panel -given mild eosinophilia , can check strongyloides antibody and stool for ova and parasites though no clear exposure history , would also check urinary histo Ag and **PHI** **PHI** ( given old granulomatous disease on chest CT ) -would consider AM cortisol to r/o adrenal insufficiency -would repeat hepatitis **PHI** ( HepB sAG , cAB , sAB , **PHI** AB , HepC Ab ) given persistent mildly elevated LFTs -would check toxoplasma DNA given risk of dz post-transplant **PHI** **PHI** Riddle MD , MPH Infectious Disease Fellow pager **PHI**
