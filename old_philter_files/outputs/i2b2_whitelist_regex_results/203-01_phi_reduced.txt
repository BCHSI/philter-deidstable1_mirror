 Record date **PHI** Reason for Visit Comprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems . Problems Congestive heart failure He had admission to MCH **PHIDate** with CHF . He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit . He was aggressively **PHI** with marked improvement in his symptoms . Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well . Most recent echo from **PHIDate** showed severely depressed LV systolic function , EF **PHI** %, global hypokinesis with antero apical akinesis . Moderate LV margin . Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement ( **PHI** mm .). Dilated aortic loop . Normal RV size and function . Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR . He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB , orthopnea or pedal edema . He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. **PHI** for his ischemic cardiomyopathy CHF . coronary artery disease After his admission for CHF , he underwent **PHI** stress test on **PHIDate** , which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid anterior and a moderate to large sized area of ischemia **PHI** and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress . Based on this , he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization . **PHIDate** he underwent stenting **PHI** of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch . Notably , his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded **PHI** and was **PHI** from the LAD , which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery . The L main had no significant lesions . The LAD had a **PHI** % lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid LAD was occluded . He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [] therapy . He was discharged the following day without complications . Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD ( see below ), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina . pacemaker S P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome **PHIDate** and doing well . Continues follow up with Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . S P CARDIAC ARREST **PHIDate** . **PHIDate** DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA , POSITIVE ETT . CATH AT **PHI** REVEALED THREE VESSEL CAD . AWAITING CABG WHEN **PHIDate** **PHI** CARDIAC ARREST . FOUND TO BE IN VT , HAD RECURRENT VT . TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD **PHIDate** . [ **PHIDate** ] He is doing well S P ICD implantation in **PHIDate** with revisions in **PHIDate** and in **PHI** hypertension BP is slightly high today , but we will recheck at next visit . If it remains elevated , would consider increasing Carvedilol diabetes mellitus He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently , they are typically in the **PHI** 's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia . He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process . Will check FBS , HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today . hypercholesterolemia He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor . We will check fasting lipids and LFT 's today . nephropathy S P renal biopsy **PHIDate** for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy . As noted above , a **PHI** hour urine recently revealed **PHI** of protein . He is on new maximal doses of ACEI 's . [ **PHIDate** ] Recheck BUN and creatinine today . peripheral vascular disease He has bilateral femoral **PHI** and diminished peripheral pulses , but because of his limited walking ability , currently has no symptoms of claudication . RECTAL FISTULA SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. **PHI** AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE . SIG . HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA . HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED . PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS , BUT WILL LET DR. **PHI** KNOW IF HE **PHI** . CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS . OSTEOARTHRITIS He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain . It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk , so that he can only `` limp less than a block '' and has difficulty with stairs . Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring , he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible . Will refer him to Dr. **PHI** for initial evaluation . Carotid stenosis According to Dr. **PHI** 's records , a carotid artery duplex scan from **PHIDate** showed **PHI** to **PHI** % stenosis of the RICA , but I do not find those records of **PHI** . Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. **PHI** . He is S P R cerebellar CVA back in **PHI** and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms . Review of Systems Small lesion on his R ear . Recent R groin infection which required treatment with **PHI** by Dr. **PHI** in **PHIDate** . Nocturia X1 . Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia . No neurologic symptoms . Denies palpitations , SOB , chest pain , lightheadedness or syncope . Denies peripheral edema . No abdominal pain or change in his bowels .
