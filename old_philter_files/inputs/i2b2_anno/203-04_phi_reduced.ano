 Record date **PHI** OFFICE NOTE **PHI** MRN **PHI** **PHI** REASON FOR VISIT Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems. PROBLEMS 1. Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer. Admitted to Massillon Community **PHI** with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer. He was managed by multiple services including EP, Cardiology, and ID. His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated with a prolonged course of fluconazole. Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed effectively with carvedilol. Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the hospitalization. He never had any sustained VT or VF. He was subsequently discharged home with a Life vest defibrillator. He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection. He currently has no AICD or pacemaker but saw Dr. **PHI** yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware for his arrhythmia issues. He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome. Currently his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current regimen as prescribed by Dr. **PHI** with close follow up. 2. CHF. Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him. He had one episode of CHF, which was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously. At the present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema. He does continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix. 3. Coronary artery disease. Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well. 4. Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty. His left TKR also required removal due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. **PHI** **PHI**. He has had no recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical issues. He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the **PHI** area. 5. Diabetes mellitus. Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen has been gradually decreased. He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. and he reports that his fasting sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120 range. He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200. We will check his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen. **PHI** MRN **PHI** **PHI** Page 2 6. Hyperlipidemia. He continues on Lipitor. We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and CPK. 7. Diabetic nephropathy. He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today to re establish baseline. 8. Status post CVA. Known moderate right carotid stenosis. Minimal residual dysarthria and right sided weakness. Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin. PHYSICAL EXAM Blood pressure by palpation 130. Was unable to get sufficient blood pressure by cuff. Pulse 60, mostly irregular. General, thin, but no distress. Lungs, clear to auscultation and percussion. Cor, distant heart sounds. No S3 appreciated. Old pacer AICD site. No evidence of erythema or fluctuance. Extremities, trace edema bilaterally. DISPOSITION Close ongoing follow up. ADDENDUM In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations. At this time, he was quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy. He did deny abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today. At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and send in to me by mail. I have also sent off a CBC today. I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his next visit. If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss more aggressive work up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first. **PHI**, M.D. Dictated Not read **PHI** cc **PHI**, M.D. Massillon Community Hospital **PHI**, Cardiology Service **PHI**, CT **PHI**
