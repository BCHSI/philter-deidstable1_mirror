 Record date **PHI** Team D Intern Admission Note Patient Name Here **PHI** MR# **PHI** Location Suite 53 02Q Date of Admission **PHI** PCP **PHI** ID CC Change in mental status HPI 70 y o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days. Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission. As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days. They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c o feeling weak and confused. The first two nights, her son treated her initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day. On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night. She also forgot the names of her grandchildren. The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED. The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago. She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection. ED Course Vitals T 98.2, HR 64, BP 215, 115, RR 24, Sa02 100% NRB. Blood Pressure Treated with labetalol 10 mg IV x 1, Hydral 10 mg IV x 1, decreased to 176 74.

Extensive neuro work up at ALH including MRI MRA, carotid non invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.

Right sided weakness. Hypertension. Procedure Contiguous axial images of the head were performed from the skull base to the vertex without intravenous contrast. Bone and soft tissue windows were reviewed. Comparison MRI dated **PHI** Findings The cerebral parenchyma, posterior fossa, basal cisterns and ventricular system appear normal. There is no evidence of any mass or mass effect. There is no evidence of acute infarction although this would be better assessed by MR with diffusion. There is no evidence of parenchymal or extra axial hemorrhage. A right frontal mucocele has enlarged since the previous exam. It extends into the right orbit resulting in proptosis. There are bilateral lens implants. IMPRESSION No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Enlarging right frontal mucocele which causes right proptosis. Pituitary MRI ( **PHI**) No evidence of recurrent pituitary adenoma. Interval increase in the size of an expansile lesion within the right ethmoid bed, with increased extension into the right orbit. The lesion contacts the right globe. This lesion most likely represents a mucocele. EKG NSR @ 73, normal axis, normal intervals, biphasic t wave v2, no sttw changes. ALH Cardiology **PHI** 13 00 DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min sec) 5 00 HR (REST = >MAX) 57  = > 76 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL = >PEAK) 146 60  = > 146 60 (MINIMUM  =  114 52) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT 11096 ENDPOINT(S) The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. The baseline cardiac rhythm was normal sinus rhythm. The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T wave abnormalities. Small inferior q's. No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS The left ventricle is normal in size. Regional left ventricular perfusion is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 77% on the stress study. Regional wall motion was normal on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans are within normal limits and do not demonstrate evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction.

LEFT ATRIUM There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation. AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. LEFT VENTRICLE The left ventricular size and systolic function are within normal limits. There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities. The estimated ejection fraction is 75%. TRICUSPID VALVE IVC, SVC There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. There is a prominent Eustachian valve. PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. Color and spectral Doppler study c w trace pulmonary insufficiency. The RV systolic pressure estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid velocity is 53 mmHg (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). RIGHT VENTRICLE The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES Echo free space between visceral & parietal pericardium is c w pericardial fat. TEST TYPE CAROTID ULTRASOUND **PHI** FINDINGS No carotid bruits are heard. Blood flow velocity is within normal limits in the common, internal, external carotid, and extracranial vertebral arteries, bilaterally. Ophthalmic artery flow is normal in direction, via the transorbital approach, bilaterally. Ultrasound visualization of the bifurcations is good. There is dense plaque visualized in each bifurcation. Plaque does not alter flow in either vessel. IMPRESSIONS 1. MINIMAL DISEASE OF BOTH CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION. LIVER, BIOPSY ( **PHI**) NOTE There is established cirrhosis, confirmed on trichrome stain. There is a mild to moderate mixed portal tract inflammatory infiltrate, composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. There is no interface or lobular activity. There is mild macrovesicular steatosis. There are scattered glycogenated nuclei in periportal hepatocytes, consistent with diabetes and or obesity. There is mild periportal edema and copper deposition, consistent with chronic cholestasis. There is no Mallory's hyaline. There is no evidence of hemachromatosis, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency or Wilson's disease based on iron, PAS D, and copper stains, respectively. The inflammatory infiltrate is not ductulocentric, and there is minimal bile duct damage. Immunostains for cytokeratins 7 and 19 highlight bile ductular reduplication, but there is no ductopenia. The findings of cirrhosis are not specific, but are compatible with end stage non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 70 y o female with PMHx sig for pituitary adenoma s p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, htn, DM, who presents with increasing confusion and depressed mental status. 1. Change in mental status 1. Hyponatremia Euvolemic by exam, Serum sodium 125, Serum Osm 262, Urine sodium 126, Urine Osm 387. Consistent with SIADH (euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia, Uosm>100, Una>20). Will place on fluid restriction, follow correction rate slowly. Past Na levels 130 ( **PHI**), 135 ( **PHI**), 133 ( **PHI**). Other etiologies diuretics, polydipsia, adrenal insufficiency, hypoaldo, third spacing less likely. 2. Hepatic encephalopathy known cirrhosis, on home standing lactulose. By exam, no asterixis. Abdomen obese but no obvious fluid collection. Somewhat tender, no peritoneal signs. Will schedule for Abdominal U S to r o ascites. Low suspicion for SBP, will hold off prophylaxis antibiotics. 3. Hypertensive encephalopthy history of mental status changes and seizures with elevated blood pressures in the past. Extremely hypertensive upon presentation to the ED. Will continue to titrate up beta blocker as tolerated, MAP goal reduction of 25% obtained, will continue to lower with PO agents. Consider MRI to look for PLE changes. 4. Infection history of chronic UTIs. U A negative, CXR negative. Will send blood cx and urine cx to complete fever work up. 5. Standard work up TSH, RPR, B12, Folate, cortisol 2. Diabetes Finger sticks with sliding scale insulin coverage QID 3. Hypothyroidism check TSH, T4, T3. Recent adjustment to synthroid dose. 4. Prolactinoma Check prolactin level, have patient bring in home cabergoline for weekly dose. **PHI**, MD Pager # **PHI**
