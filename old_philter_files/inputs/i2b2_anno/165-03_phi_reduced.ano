 Record date **PHI** NAME **PHI** MRN **PHI** **PHI** returns for follow up of painful neuropathy. A lot has happened since she was seen. She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in **PHI**. She therefore has been having financial problems. She does not have enough money to buy her medications. She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. She has not taken these medications for months. She states she has been taking her nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed. When I called her from the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before she fell. We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was taken. She reports being off balance for about the past month. She has been feeling more unsteady on her feet. She states she has not actually fallen but has come close to falling. She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait. On review of other systems, she reports a 20 lb. weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not working and being at home and eating more than usual. She also notes that she has begun urinating at night which she previously did not do. She complains of excessive dry mouth. She reports being more thirsty than usual. PHYSICAL EXAM On exam, she was her usual pleasant self. She is alert and oriented X 3. Speech fluent without aphasia. BP sitting 145 70. Pulse 80. Standing BP unchanged at 145 70. Pulse 80. Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent bilateral nystagmus. Otherwise intact. On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary movements. No drift. Good power throughout. Fine finger movements intact. Vibratory loss to the ankles. Babinski flexor bilaterally. When she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her. IMPRESSION Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed. Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth. Her exam is notable for prominent end gaze nystagmus. Therefore I suspect toxic metabolic cause. As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER. I will be in touch with the physicians after they see her. **PHI**, M.D. **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** cc **PHI**, M.D.
