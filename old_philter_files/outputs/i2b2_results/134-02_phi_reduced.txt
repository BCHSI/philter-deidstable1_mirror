I think it would be **PHI** to start on a low dose of a **PHI** lowering medicine , glipizide ( Glucotrol ). I would start on **PHIDate** of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time . If they stay a bit up , then increase to one whole pill ( 5 mg ) twice a day . Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar . I do n't think this will interfere with your trip . Call me in a week to tell me how it is going . **PHI** wishes , O
