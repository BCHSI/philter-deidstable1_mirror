 Record date **PHI** MSH Adult Medicine Office Visit **PHI** Dr **PHI** 73 yr old woman with HTN , SP CABG , fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K. She was hospitalized in **PHIDate** for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia . At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx . Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early **PHI** her K+ rose a bit . The VNA has been seeing her at home . According to the patient her BP has been `` normal ''. She and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA . They are seeing me because there were no appts available for her with her PCP . She denies any chest pain , shortness of breath . Appetite is good . She has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K+ content of many foods . She has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2095 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years .

A 73 yr old with HTN has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking ACEi concomitantly with NSAID . The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in **PHIDate** and again in early **PHI** is unclear . She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms . I do n't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi . P Her daughter had many questions about what this type of `` blockage '' means and about prognosis . I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion , renal function , and to advise her about the role impact of ACEi for BP and her heart ( her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she does n't take the ACEi ). I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID . I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction . Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K+ foods . Check lytes , renal function , Phos , Ca and Alb today . Will discuss Nephrology consultation with Dr **PHI** . She has an appt with Dr **PHI** on **PHIDate** . Length of visit was 45 minutes . **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
