His daughter in law states that he has also been increasingly confused during this time period. He has been confusing the time of day (confusing night for daytime and vice versa), increasingly forgetful, and falling more than usual. He has been falling with increasing frequency over the last 3 months. On average, he would fall about once a week. On the day prior to admission, the pt walked to Procter Gamble (2 blocks from house) and fell twice. He was helped back up by by standers. He describes the fall as his legs giving out from under him, and has been shuffling his gait more than usual recently.

Assessment 76yo M w history of DM, HTN, and h o of CVA presents with AMS and increasing falls in setting of influenza. PLAN 1. Delirium Pt's waxing and waning mental status likely secondary from his underlying infectious processes influenza and UTI. a. Correct hyponatremia b. Monitor mental status as infection is treated 2. Falls Pt's recent falls likely have a multifactorial etiology. Pt has many risk factors for falls including visual impairment, mild cognitive impairment (on MMSE), possible diabetic neuropathy, and a. Check orthostatic vital signs b. Check RPR B12 c. Pt needs PT evaluation, may require walker or other equipment to help him ambulate 3. Hypovolemic Hyponatremia Pt clinically appears hypovolemic. A FeNa of 0.5% also suggests a hypovolemic picture. a. Will check Na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue IVFs 4. UTI Pt has positive U A and UC for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity). Staph is an unusual cause of a UTI. A further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted. Empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant CNS. a. F u UC b. Empiric treatment with Vancomycin 1g q12h for 7 days (CrCl > 60), await c&s for possible alternative agents 5. Influenza A a. Continuous oxygen monitoring b. Supportive care 6.
