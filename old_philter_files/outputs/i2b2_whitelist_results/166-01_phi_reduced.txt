 Record date : **PHI** PATIENT NAME : **PHI** , **PHI** ; MRN : **PHI** Dictated on : **PHI** by **PHI** M. **PHI** , M.D . Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE : DATE OF CONSULTATION : DIAGNOSIS : T2b , NX , M0 Gleason **PHI** = **PHI** adenocarcinoma of the prostate . HISTORY : Mr. **PHI** is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. **PHI** **PHI** . His PSA in **PHI** was **PHI** , early this year **PHI** , and on repeat **PHI** . Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam . He has very **PHI** in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream , no dribbling , nor any frequency . He does still have his erections , though they are not as good as they used to be . The erections are still an important issue with him . Dr. **PHI** performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a **PHI** cc prostate . He took **PHI** biopsy cores and all **PHI** demonstrated prostate cancer . In **PHI** it was Gleason **PHI** and in the remainder Gleason **PHI** . Many cores had a predominant Gleason **PHI** pattern . Many of the cores were heavily involved with **PHI** % involvement or more . Mr. **PHI** has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : **PHI** . Diabetes . **PHI** . Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy . **PHI** . Tonsillectomy . **PHI** . Right inguinal hernia repair . **PHI** . Inflammatory bowel disease . CURRENT MEDICATIONS : Glipizide , metformin , and Avandia . DRUG ALLERGIES : None known . SOCIAL HISTORY : His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late **PHI** , but he did not die from his disease . SOCIAL HISTORY : He works as a Web Developer in **PHI** . He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today . He has no children . He is a former smoker and occasional drinker . PHYSICAL EXAM : No anemia , jaundice , cyanosis , or clubbing No gynecomastia Respiration comfortable No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs No skeletal deformity or tenderness Head , eyes , ears , and nose normal Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , nor any additional masses . No hernias . Normal penis , scrotum , and testes . Rectum : no mural lesion . Stool guaiac negative Prostate is small . The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor . IMPRESSION AND PLAN : Mr. **PHI** is a **PHI** man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer . I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him , which is a shame , as that was his preference . Left untreated , I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years . His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment . On balance , my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy , perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively , if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does , for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation . While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this . We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans . Obviously , should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table , if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation . Hopefully neither of these **PHI** will occur . **PHI** M. **PHI** , M.D . cc : **PHI** U. **PHI** , M.D .
