	CARDIOLOGY
	

	SOUTH OAKS HOSPITAL
	


	Interval History:
   Mr. Crawford returns to the clinic for routine scheduled follow-up.  His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension. In the interval, since our last visit, he has done well from a CV perspective. He has had no episodes of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He did unfortunately have an episode of diverticulosis requiring hospitalization at Oakcrest Nursing Home. He did not require transfusion. The bleeding sounds as though it was self-limiting and has not recurred. Otherwise, his health is unchanged.  He remains fairly limited due to his osteoarthritis but continues to perform all ADLs successfully.

	

	Changes to Allergies
	
BRIMONIDINE TARTRATE - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]
Latex - reaction: Rash [reviewed]
no known allergies: He has no current allergies - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   50, which is strong and regular
-resp. rate:   12.  He is saturating 100% at room air
-Extremities:   There is trace dependent 1+ lower extremity swelling, which is stable.
-Abdomen:   Soft and nontender.

-Chest:   His lungs are clear.

	Impression:
   1.) Nonobstructive CAD
2.) Neurocardiogenic syncope
3.) Hypertension


	Assessment and plan:
   Overall he is doing well his cardiovascular issues are stable.  His blood pressure slightly above goal but given his past syncopal tendencies with aggressive lowering will hold off on any med changes for now.  I will see him back in six months, sooner if new issues arise.
