She drinks one cup of coffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will occasionally have one , a scotch , on Friday or Saturday . She does not do drugs . She will return in three week for follow up of her blood pressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due . 2 . Diabetes . The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it . Her creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment . We will start her on Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d . I expect we will need to increase this and if she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week . I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication . I suggested she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is eating . I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry . She also requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with **PHI** HUNTINGTON **PHI** HEALTH CENTER **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** ( **PHI** **PHIDate** Page 2 lancets , alcohol wipes and test strips and again she will return in two weeks for follow up . **PHI** **PHI** , M.D .
