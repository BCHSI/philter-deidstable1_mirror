ADDENDUM:

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Radiologic studies also included a chest
CT, which confirmed cavitary lesions in the left lung apex
consistent with infectious process/tuberculosis.  This also
moderate-sized left pleural effusion.

HEAD CT:  Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect, but old infarction consistent with past medical
history.

ABDOMINAL CT:  Abdominal CT showed lesions of
T10 and sacrum most likely secondary to osteoporosis. These can
be followed by repeat imaging as an outpatient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with a history of emphysema (not on home O2), who presents
with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary
care doctor to be a COPD flare.  Two days prior to admission,
she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to
admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain
oxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on
levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and
presented to the ***REMOVED*****Hospital1 18*****REMOVED*** Emergency Room.

In the ***REMOVED*****Hospital3 *****REMOVED*** Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was
100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this
despite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.

Review of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,
gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,
palpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:
Chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with
exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally
related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in ***REMOVED*****2117-11-3*****REMOVED***
demonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of
predicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of
67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator
treatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with
bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible
air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive
ventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home
oxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on
steroid taper or been intubated in the past.
2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in ***REMOVED*****2114-11-4*****REMOVED***
demonstrates ""mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2
signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres
as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to
the right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific
in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic
microvascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of
the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major
vascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate
right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left
maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal
thickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic
or some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally
noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella
turcica"".
3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in ***REMOVED*****2118-1-3*****REMOVED***
going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of
10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence
of ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of
the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and
a calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  The patient denies
angina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks.
Are alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin.
4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid.
5. Depression on Lexapro.
6. Motor vehicle accident with head injury approximately 10
years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d.
2. Prednisone 60 mg, 50 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg.

ALLERGIES:  Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband, Dr. ***REMOVED*****Known lastname 1809*****REMOVED*** an
eminent Pediatric Neurologist at ***REMOVED*****Hospital3 1810*****REMOVED***.  The
patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10
years.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,
heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%
axillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP
with dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent
distress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx
difficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of
jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP
machine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured
by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory
phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the
lung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower
extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There
is a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as ***REMOVED*****5-9*****REMOVED*** in the
lower extremities, ***REMOVED*****5-9*****REMOVED*** in the upper extremities with a normal
mental status and cognition.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets
300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was
negative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas
showed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.

Chest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,
segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus
segmental atelectasis.

EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal
axis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed
on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation
despite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer
treatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were
increased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have
labored breathing.

Due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,
the patient was intubated on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-7*****REMOVED*** in order to improve
oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A
bronchoscopy was performed on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-7*****REMOVED***, which demonstrated
marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent
with tracheomalacia.

On ***REMOVED*****2118-6-9*****REMOVED***, two silicone stents were placed, one in the left
main stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.
***REMOVED*****First Name (STitle) *****REMOVED*** ***REMOVED*****Name (STitle) *****REMOVED*** under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.

On ***REMOVED*****2118-6-11*****REMOVED***, the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel
mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal
cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical
floor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off
on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-14*****REMOVED***, and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2
liters, 92% on room air.

On ***REMOVED*****2118-6-14*****REMOVED***, the patient was seen again by the Interventional
Pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved
and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with
followup within six weeks' time status post placement of
stents in respiratory failure.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She
did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,
which showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative
troponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,
Imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient
regimen.

3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and
hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and
normalization of electrolytes.

4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely
secondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was
discontinued on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-14*****REMOVED***.  She had serial urinalyses, which
were all negative for signs of infection.

5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding
scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This
worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels
once the steroids were tapered to off.

6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of
20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids
were tapered to off, her white blood cell count on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-14*****REMOVED***
was 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary
to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe
pneumonia.

7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had
initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.
from ***REMOVED*****2118-6-4*****REMOVED*** to ***REMOVED*****2118-6-10*****REMOVED***.  This was restarted on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-12*****REMOVED***
for an additional seven day course given the fact that she
still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the
left lower lobe.

8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient
medical regimen.

9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per
outpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up
with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she
did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital
course, and did appear clinically to be depressed.

10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor
with subQ Heparin.

11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much
of the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated
with Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution
containing Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.

12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code
throughout her hospital course, and communication was
maintained with the patient and her husband.

13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle
weakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found
to have impaired functional mobility, impaired
musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired
endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine
to sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair
for approximately one hour.

On motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower
extremities were ***REMOVED*****4-8*****REMOVED*** at the knee, ***REMOVED*****4-8*****REMOVED*** at the ankle, ***REMOVED*****4-8*****REMOVED*** at
the elbows, and ***REMOVED*****4-8*****REMOVED*** hips.  It was felt that this weakness was
most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well
as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a
prolonged hospital course.

14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow
evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of
vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on
room air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly
weak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood
pressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with
transmitted upper airway sounds.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to ***REMOVED*****Hospital1 *****REMOVED***
for both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.
2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.

13. Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn.
14. SubQ Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until such
time that the patient is able to get out of bed twice a day.
15. Cepacol lozenges q.2h. prn.
16. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a seven day course to
be completed on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-21*****REMOVED***.
17. Kaopectate/Benadryl/lidocaine 5 mL p.o. b.i.d. prn, not
to be given around mealtimes for concern of dysphagia induced
by lidocaine.
18. Lorazepam 0.5-2 mg IV q.6h. prn.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is recommended to followup with
Dr. ***REMOVED*****First Name4 (NamePattern1) *****REMOVED*** ***REMOVED*****Last Name (NamePattern1) 1407*****REMOVED***, ***REMOVED*****Telephone/Fax (1) 1408*****REMOVED*** within two weeks of leaving
of the hospital.  She is also recommended to followup with
the Interventional Pulmonary service for followup status post
stent placement.  She is also recommended to followup with a
neurologist if her muscle weakness does not improve within
one week on physical therapy with concern for steroid-induced
myopathy.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Tracheomalacia status post tracheal and left main stem
bronchial stent placement.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Restrictive lung defect.
5. Depression.

History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five

years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.
In
***REMOVED*****2118-6-4*****REMOVED*** she was admitted to ***REMOVED*****Hospital1 18*****REMOVED*** for respiratory failure
due
to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she
required
intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on ***REMOVED*****2118-6-9*****REMOVED*** revealed marked

narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with
tracheomalacia.
She subsequently underwent placement of two
silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the
trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of
chest
pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to

***REMOVED*****Hospital1 *****REMOVED*** for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy
on
***REMOVED*****2118-8-1*****REMOVED*** revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral
wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the

peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the
airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were
also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in
her
respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion
with Dr. ***REMOVED*****First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951*****REMOVED*** ***REMOVED*****Last Name (NamePattern1) 952*****REMOVED*** regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty

with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c ***REMOVED*****2119-4-19*****REMOVED*** in anticipation of
surgery.
In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent
chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any

time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and
states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.
She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters
around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up ""dark
sputum"".

Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation/Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
arterial line placement
PICC line placement
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed
an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient
tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be
tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER.
.
According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms
consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was
without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND,
dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a
physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning.
.
In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal
any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory
evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2.
Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1,
aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg
IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient
became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but
became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was
removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2
hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and
tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation
ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to
fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of
NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x
18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2.
.
In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.

CXR (***REMOVED*****2124-7-21*****REMOVED***) - IMPRESSION: Hiatal hernia, otherwise
unremarkable. Limited exam.

Echo (***REMOVED*****2124-7-24*****REMOVED***) - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR (***REMOVED*****2124-8-5*****REMOVED***) - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day
earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided
effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant
change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity
consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again
seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, no s/p intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Presents with dyspnea, but no
clear cough or fevers. Per report, patient felt like this with
prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible
pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with
this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram
stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew
parainfluenze type 3 on ***REMOVED*****7-24*****REMOVED***. Patient was initially managed on
solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no
evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics
were stopped ***REMOVED*****7-25*****REMOVED***. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were
continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with
normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On ***REMOVED*****7-26*****REMOVED***, bronchoscopy
revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had
difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become
interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the
50s. Patient was extubatied on ***REMOVED*****7-27*****REMOVED*** after passing SBT 0/5, but
required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening
secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of
note, on ***REMOVED*****8-1*****REMOVED***, the patient was found to have MRSA growing in
sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely
represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the
patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped
after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's
family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, ***REMOVED*****Name10 (NameIs) *****REMOVED*** the palliative
care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she
would not want a tracheostomy. On ***REMOVED*****2124-8-3*****REMOVED***, extubation was pursued
again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory
status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical
floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with
nebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical
exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently
diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath
with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks
of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her
breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was
begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3
more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4
days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.
.
# Upper GI bleeding: On ***REMOVED*****7-22*****REMOVED***, patient had coffee grounds from OG
tube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD
which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach
body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was
negative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat
EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved
given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable
with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the
patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO
pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.
.
# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness
at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and
they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy
and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was
checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and
physical rehab.
.
# CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents.
Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI
bleeding (see above)
.
# Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due
to hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on
***REMOVED*****7-26*****REMOVED*** for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient
was extubated on ***REMOVED*****2124-8-3*****REMOVED***. Speech and swallow were consulted
following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved
to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.

# Goals of care: PCP ***REMOVED*****Last Name (NamePattern4) *****REMOVED***. ***REMOVED*****Last Name (STitle) 1407*****REMOVED*** was very involved in discussions
regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed
along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's
extubation on ***REMOVED*****2124-8-3*****REMOVED***, it was decided that the patient would be
DNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family
felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that
she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status
were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on
comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the
floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with
intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.
After several days with stable or improved overall clinical
status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem
of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,
okay to intubate.
