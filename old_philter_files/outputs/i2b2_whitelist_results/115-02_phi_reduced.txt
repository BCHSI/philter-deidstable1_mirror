Saint **PHI** Hospital **PHI** **PHI** Street **PHI** , AL **PHI** Re : **PHI** Werner MRN **PHI** Dear **PHI** : **PHI** Werner is doing better than the last time I saw her in May in that the triglycerides have decreased to **PHI** , pretty much where they had usually been . The LDL is now quite low at **PHI** but the HDL has declined to **PHI** . All in all , the results are compatible with better glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin **PHI** mg is likely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand discontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL . The effect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is minimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is **PHI** except at the high dose of **PHI** mg . Even at **PHI** mg Atorvastatin could not compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action . Her current medications are Atorvastatin **PHI** mg , Lopressor **PHI** mg , Procardia **PHI** mg b.i.d., Capoten **PHI** mg t.i.d., and Insulin **PHI** units A.M. Labs : Cholesterol **PHI** , TG . **PHI** , HDL **PHI** , LDL **PHI** . Blood pressure is **PHI** . I restarted the Gemfibrozil , **PHI** mg b.i.d . and left her on the Atorvastatin **PHI** mg . Although I do n't expect any side effects with this low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I **PHI** Mrs. Werner and her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or weakness she should contact us and discontinue medication . I think that aggressive therapy is **PHI** in Mrs. Werner . page **PHI** **PHI** Werner November **PHI** , **PHI** Please feel free to call or e-mail me if you have questions . **PHI** Wishes .
