EDVISIT^72841920^MULLINS, DOLORES^07/19/80^TAVARES, IDRIS

I saw this patient with Dr. Xavier Palacios.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

Please see the resident's note for further details.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fast heart rate.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of a left MCA stroke, atrial fibrillation,

hypertension, diabetes, and renal insufficiency who was

transferred from Southwest Montana Radiology for atrial

fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The patient has

been in Southwest Montana for the last several weeks.  During her

rehabilitation stay, the patient was noted to have sinus

bradycardia and sinus pauses.  The patient's metoprolol was

stopped.  The patient was previously on metoprolol 6.25 mg every

6 hours.  The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation with

rapid ventricular response on exam this morning.  The patient is

followed by Dr. Octavia Xue of Heritage Hospital Cardiology. 

Given the difficulty that Southwest Montana has had ____

the patient's atrial fibrillation, the patient was transferred

here to Riverton General Hospital for further management and

further placement.  The patient is asymptomatic.  The patient

denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient denies

any lightheadedness.  The patient has no other complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the

following:  Temperature is 96.4, heart rate of 79, respiratory

rate of 18, blood pressure is 112/63, and oxygen saturations at

100% on room air.  The patient's oxygen saturation was

interpreted as normal.  General:  No acute distress, pleasant,

and multiple family members at bedside.  HEENT:  The patient's

head was normocephalic.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Posterior

oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  Supple.  No carotid bruits.  No

JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No focal

rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly

irregular, tachycardic.  No gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops were

appreciated.  GI:  Abdomen:  Soft.  No rebound or guarding. 

Minimal suprapubic tenderness to palpation.  G-tube in place. 

Rectal exam:  Deferred.  GU exam:  Deferred.  Skin:  Warm and

dry.  No rash or lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral

angle tenderness.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.  Lower

extremity pitting edema rising up to the knees.  No palpable

cords.  Neurologic:  The patient was alert and oriented.  The

patient moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.  The patient

did have a right facial droop.  I did not ambulate the patient.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of atrial fibrillation, and recent left MCA stroke

who was transferred from Southwest Montana for management

of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The

patient is hemodynamically stable at this time.  The patient is

asymptomatic.  The patient will need rate control and will need

to be admitted to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient then had 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's

12-lead EKG was notable for atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response.  The patient did have some nonspecific ST-T

changes when compared to her prior EKG.  The patient's laboratory

studies so far has been largely unremarkable.  The patient's

first set of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's

complete blood count was notable for an elevated white blood cell

count of 10.8.  The patient's hematocrit of 33.2.  The patient's

platelets were somewhat elevated at 560,000.  The patient's

portable chest x-ray has been ordered and results of the

patient's portable chest x-ray are still pending at this time. 

The case was then discussed with the Heritage Hospital

cardiologist on call.  The patient ____ will be admitted to

Heritage Hospital Cardiology and to a monitor bed.  I did try to

page Dr. Octavia Xue to let her know about the patient's

admission to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.  The patient and

patient's family were in agreement with the plan.  The patient

was started on metoprolol down her G-tube.  The patient had a

good response to the metoprolol.  The patient was given

metoprolol 6.25 mg.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

2.  History of a left MCA stroke.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Heritage Hospital

Cardiology.

CONDITION AT TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.
