Plan:



1.	DOE: Concern is new cardiomyopathy with failure secondary to adriamycin toxicity, nl ECHO in 2080

-check TTE tomorrow (also access for thrombus although pt already anticoagulated)

-currently clincially euvolemic, no diuresis for now

2.	New onset AVR with RVR: Possible etiologies:

 -new ischemia (cardiac enzymes neg x 3, no EKG changes)

-CHF (see above discussion)

-pulm disease (CXR w/ b/l small pleural effusions ), could be pulm tox secondary to chemo

-thyrotoxicosis (history of benign thyroid nodules but could be active now) check TSH

-rate controlled with diltiazem and lopressor, d/c dig

-already on coumadin s/p CVA with goal INR 2-3

3.	s/p CVA

-continue coumadin, check INR

4.	Prophylaxis

-nexium, coumadin

5.	Dispo
