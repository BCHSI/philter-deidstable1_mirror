   Echo: 
At OSH in Columbia:  LVH, nl fxn, AV calcified. Max gradient 62, mean 38mmHg. Mild Aortic regurg.

   EKG: 
Sinus brady at 55 bpm, nl axis, 1st degree AV block, STD/TWI in I, II, III, aVF, V5, V6. LVH pattern w/ J pt elevation in V1-V3.  

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
54 y/o Spanish speaking male with HTN, HL presents to PNC after syncopal episode 2 days ago and was found to have AS at OSH.  Mean gradient of 38mmHg indicates moderate disease.  Prognosis after syncopal episode due to AS is 3 years.

AS:  Monitor for syncope, CHF, ischemia
Repeat Echo to assess valve area, gradients
Afterload reduction--start on ACE
Cont statin, check lipid panel
Avoid nitrates, diuretics
His symptomatic AS warrants w/u for AVR
Ischemia: EKG changes c/w LVH although doesn   t quite LVH meet criteria. Did have + enzymes at OSH, although denies hx of chest pain. Positive biomarkers ? due to coronary insufficiency in the setting of AS.
Cont ASA, lipitor
Cycle enzymes
Will likely need coronary angiography before AVR
Hyperlipidemia
Lipitor
Prophylaxis
Nexium
Enoxaparin
Code
