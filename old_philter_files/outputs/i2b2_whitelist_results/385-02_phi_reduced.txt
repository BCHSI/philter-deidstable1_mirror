 Record date : **PHI** Infectious Disease Consultation Patient Name : **PHI** , **PHI** MR : **PHI** Reason for consult : assistance with management of possible persistent L shoulder septic arthritis in patient pre-op for planned hip replacement Source : patient , MR **PHI** requested by : Dr. **PHI** **PHI** Date of consult : **PHI** Location : **PHI** **PHI** HPI : Mr. **PHI** is a **PHI** yo M with PmHx significant for DMII , CHF ( EF **PHI** %), afib , Parkinson 's , prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB , multiple hip replacements , s/p multiple knee surgeries who , recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis ( **PHI** ) who presented **PHI** s/p fall . Mr. **PHI** has experienced multiple falls recently , and was ultimately diagnosed with Parkinsons last September . Following the diagnosis , he was discharged to **PHI** City Hospital , where he continued to experience falls . After one episode , he was forcibly **PHI** up , and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter . He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal . After several **PHI** of worsening shoulder pain , erythema , and warmth , he was **PHI** at **PHI** , where he underwent L shoulder aspiration . MRI **PHI** demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff , with associated large joint effusion . Of note , he denied fevers , chills , or NS . L shoulder aspiration **PHI** demonstrated purulent fluid , with **PHI** WBC ( **PHI** % PMN ). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters . He subsequently underwent L shoulder I & D **PHI** , with removal of **PHI** of frankly purulent fluid . He was started on cefazolin . Culture results returned a **PHI** Staphylococcus aureus isolate ( including to ampicillin , cefazolin , clindamycin , penicillin , rifampin ). Blood cultures were negative . He was taken back to the OR **PHI** for arthroscopy , with extensive debridement . **PHI** findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue , with no **PHI** **PHI** present . A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid **PHI** , and a second in the subacromial space . He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g **PHI** hours x **PHI** **PHI** , and then given amoxicillin ( either 1g BID or 500mg TID , unsure which ) x **PHI** **PHI** . Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained **PHI** , which was reviewed with staff radiologist , and demonstrated again complete tear of the **PHI** minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons , with also persistent large joint effusion , extensive synovitis , and full thickness **PHI** loss of glenoid and humeral head . Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head . Overall , was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease . Mr. **PHI** was seen in the ID clinic **PHI** , at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity . He did not experience shoulder pain at rest , and had not recently noted erythema . No drainage . Appetite was near baseline , though he had experienced fatigue . Blood **PHI** had been well controlled . His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs , which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of **PHI** , with stable **PHI** , and overall well controlled blood sugars . Date ESR CRP **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Unfortunately , Mr. **PHI** sustained a mechanical fall **PHI** . Following the fall , he had significantly increased hip pain . **PHI** films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than **PHI** **PHI** and along the stem . Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision . ROS : as per HPI . Denied having R hip pain prior to his fall . No cough , sore throat , chest discomfort , abdominal pain , dysuria , diarrhea . Extensive ROS otherwise negative . PmHx : h/o L shoulder septic joint s/p I/D in **PHI** c/b hemorrhage as per HPI CHF ( EF **PHI** %) s/p **PHI** hip surgeries , s/p bilateral hip replacements . S/p R THA with revision x **PHI** , last **PHI** ( **PHI** ), s/p l THA with revision x **PHI** . Afib , maintained on coumadin DMII , diagnosed **PHI** years ago . Unsure of last A1c CRI ( baseline Cr **PHI** ) HTN Parkinson 's disease , prostate ca s/p radiation c/b radiation proctitis , **PHI** , thought secondary to radiation proctitis . Was to have a colonoscopy this week . Admitted with GIB **PHI** . s/p multiple knee surgeries GERD melanoma s/p excision s/p cholecystectomy .

No tobacco , EtOH , or IVDU . Retired . FHx : Noncontributory P.E . VS : **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** % RA Gen : found lying flat in bed , in no acute distress Skin : no rashes . Multiple areas of ecchymoses , with some skin breakdown , on extremities bilaterally ( he attributes this to multiple falls ) HEENT : anicteric , conjunctiva uninjected . No sinus tenderness .

The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear . The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than **PHI** **PHI** and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease . There is no subsidence or loosening based on **PHI** 's classification . AP chest film : no acute pulmonary process , probable cardiomegaly . Assessment : **PHI** yo M with DMII , CHF ( EF **PHI** %), afib , Parkinson 's , prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB , multiple hip replacements , recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis ( **PHI** - **PHI** ) who presented **PHI** s/p fall . With regards to his shoulder , it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the **PHI** abx course . Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam , **PHI** months after completion of his course , it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis . The MRI is difficult to interpret , and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes . He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers ( though **PHI** by multiple **PHI** ). Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection , our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically , off abx , for signs of recurrent infection . However , given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement , would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder . As such , would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics . The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated , and blood cultures were negative . However , such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding , and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected . This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening . Alternatively , he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls , or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (? read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis ). Recommendations : -hold antibiotics , including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data -Aspirate shoulder . Send fluid for cell counts , Gram stain , **PHI** cultures -if do not see contraindication to **PHI** with planned hip replacement -would obtain hip biopsies in the OR , again off abx , to assess for possible hip infection -likewise , would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement -check CK , given elevated Cr following fall , and possible rhabdo Thank you for this interesting consultation .
