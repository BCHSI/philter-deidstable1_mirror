a/p: weight gain is concerning to me as he has h/o increased blood sugars: advised him to try to lose 10 lbs, we'll check his hga1c and fasting sugar again as well. I'm concerned that he will end up need ing medication for this if he continues to gain weight.  



his lipids were up last check, but his daughter recollects that he ate a full breakfast prior to that lab draw.. will repeat fasting.



htn: in good control



cad: pt to see cardiology next wednesday.  I advised him he would probably need a statin if LDL isn't in the 60's fasting again.



f/u in 3 mos
