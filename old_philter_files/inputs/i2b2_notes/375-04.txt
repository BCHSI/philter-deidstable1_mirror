-------------------------------

6/08/2158 1:31 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 100/42 and  his
pulse was 60 per minute  when lying; his blood pressure was 80/40 and  his
pulse was 64 rrr per minute  when sitting.  The orthostatic change was
symptomatic.  He appeared well-nourished and well-groomed.
6/08/2158 1:36 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 90/40 when
sitting.

Rating Scales:
UPDRS Subscale III (Motor Examination):  Subscale total score was 22 out of
108.  This subscale was completed while the patient was ON.

Tremor at rest was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 0 in the
face, 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity, 0 in the
right lower extremity, 0 in the left lower extremity,.

Action or postural tremor of the hands was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0
being absent): 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity,.

Rigidity was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 1 in the right
upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity, 1 in the right lower extremity,
1 in the left lower extremity,.

The following movements were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being normal): 
    Finger Taps: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity;
    Hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper
extremity;
    Rapid alternating hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the
left upper extremity;
    Leg agility: 1 in the right lower extremity, 2 in the left lower extremity.

Each of the following was rated on a 0-4 scale (with 0 being normal):
    Speech:  1 (slight loss of expression, diction and/or volume);
    Facial expression:  1 (minimal hypomimia; could be normal 'pokerface');
    Arising from a chair:  1 (slow or may need more than one attempt);
    Posture:  1 (not quite erect, slightly stooped posture; could be normal for
older person);
    Gait:  2 (walks with difficulty but requires little or no assistance; may
have some festination, short steps, or propulsion);
    Postural stability:  1 (retropulsion, but recovers unaided);
    Body bradykinesia and hypokinesia:  2 (mild degree of slowness & poverty of
movement that is definitely abnormal; alternatively, some reduced amplitude).

Assessment:  
  1.  Parkinson's Disease:  Parkinson with decline in strength and endurance.
It is possible that the added  Sinemet is causing a decrease in his blood
pressure. I made a referral to Mary Darnell PT here at TMH. In addition Dr
Edward Nguyen felt a slight reduction of the Sinemet to 1.5 tab QID may help his
blood pressure with out changing his motor ability. RTC 1 month Dr Edward Nguyen
and 2 months Genevieve Noland, NP
