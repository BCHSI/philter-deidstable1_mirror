MRN: 

7826250(GNC)
ID/CC/Reason for consult: ? 

Acute stroke



HPI: 



63 year old RH man with history of CAD s/p STEMI 2077 s/p 8 stents including LAD, systolic CHF Class Ia with EF 20% s/p BiV ICD placement, diabetes, on Coumadin and ASA, presenting with history of right arm/leg weakness since this morning.  He was alone at home this morning (family was out), and he noted a change from normal at 9:00am. He had difficulty using his right arm and when he went to walk he felt unsteady and had to sit down.  He was also lightheaded at that time.  He had no focal weakness of his face.  He also denies any tingling/numbness anywhere in the body, or any changes in speech, language, or comprehension.  He did not call his family and instead ignored his symptoms.  His wife called him around noon to check in, at which point he told her about his right-sided weakness.  She then insisted that they come in to the ED for evaluation; they called EMS, and he was transported by ambulance to the ED.  


He denies any headache, neck pain, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  His LVAD was last flushed 2 days ago by his wife; she flushes it every Thursday.
  

In the ED, BP 114/82, HR 69, and he is 99% on room air.

Head CT/CTA Head and Neck (Today): 





No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, masses or large territorial infarction.

Left M1 segment filling defect likely represent a thrombus which is partially occlusive given the opacification of the distal MCA 
branches. This finding correlates with patient's given symptoms.



EKG (Today): 








CXR (Today): Large heart


Assessment
: 
63 year old RH man with history of CAD s/p STEMI 2077 s/p 8 stents including LAD, systolic CHF Class Ia with EF 20% s/p BiV ICD placement, diabetes, on Coumadin and ASA, presenting with history of right arm/leg weakness since this morning.  There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.  Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.  He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE. He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.  NIHSS was zero.  CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.  There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.


The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.  He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.  


Plan: 


- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
- Neuro checks q4 hours
- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.

- Keep K&amp;gt;4, Mg&amp;gt;2
- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
- Check blood cultures
- Check chromogenic Factor X level
- PT/OT evaluation
- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&amp;lt;130




Thank you for this consult. Please page 90395 with any questions or concerns.
