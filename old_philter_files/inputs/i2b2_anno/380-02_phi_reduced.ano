As you know she is a 72 year old woman with prior stroke. I will review his medical history for our records. HPI This is a 72 year old right handed woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia and PAF with a prior stroke (2067) who subsequently was admitted to the OCH again for SDH with supratherapeutic INR in 2068. She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery. She is here with her family who is translating. She ambulates with walker, but does well over short distances without it. She communicates well with eth family and is able to feed and dress herself. She has an aid for bathing three ties per week. She has not needed the PEG tube in the past 6 months and is eager to have it removed. She has not had any new episodes of weakness, numbness, visual or language changes.

DATA MRI 2068 old right MCA stroke CT 2068 SDH ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 72 year old woman with vascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation and prior stroke with a subsequent SDH with super elevated INR who now returns for follow up. She has had a significant recovery. Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification. Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin, until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them. She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well. She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr **PHI** for this. RTC as needed. Call with questions. More than 50% of this visit was spent on patient education and counseling. Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. I will continue to follow along with you. Sincerely, **PHI**, M.D., Ph.D. Department of Neurology Stroke Division Orange City Hospital **PHI**, MS **PHI**
