Left M1 segment filling defect likely represent a thrombus which is partially occlusive given the opacification of the distal MCA branches . This finding correlates with patient 's given symptoms . EKG ( Today ): CXR ( Today ): Large heart Assessment : **PHI** year old RH man with history of CAD s/p STEMI **PHI** s/p **PHI** stents including LAD , systolic CHF Class Ia with EF **PHI** % s/p BiV ICD placement , diabetes , on Coumadin and ASA , presenting with history of right **PHI** weakness since this morning . There have been no other neurological symptoms , and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness . Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity , without facial involvement . He has pronator drift on the right , with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right , and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE . He has no sensory findings , and no dysarthria or aphasia . **PHI** was zero . CT Brain shows loss of **PHI** differentiation in Left MCA territory , with Left M1 clot . There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution . The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD . He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following . Plan :- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management - Stroke consult service to follow ( pager **PHI** )- Head and neck imaging complete ; f/u final read - Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam - Neuro checks q4 hours - LVAD needs to be **PHI** if possible for thrombus ; will consult patient 's private cardiologist - Check baseline **PHI** ; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring - To improve perfusion , maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function ; patient does not appear to be **PHI** at this time - Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention , currently **PHI** small stroke - Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry - **PHI** with serial CE q **PHI** x3 , and serial EKGs . - Keep K & gt ; **PHI** , Mg & gt ; **PHI** - Risk factor assessment : ESR , CRP , HBA1c - Check blood cultures - Check chromogenic Factor X level - **PHI** evaluation - Hold **PHI** XL : use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose & lt ; **PHI** Thank you for this consult .
