There is a region of low attenuation in the left occipital lobe which may represent a subacute infarct. MRI of the brain with DWI would be helpful for further characterization. 2. Right maxillary sinus and nondisplaced right orbital floor fractures, as described above. 3. Mild atrophy and nonspecific white matter change likely related to microangiopathic small vessel ischemic change. 4. Old left thalamic infarct. A P 57 yoM w MMP presenting with syncope and facial fracture. Appears to have recurrent syncope of unclear etiology. Cardiac etiology would be of greatest concern given hx of CAD and chest pain, though certainly cerebrovascular disease is present given CVA history. Plan 1. Neuro hx of CVA on ASA MRI MRA to r o vertebrobasilar disease 2. PULM CPAP at night for OSA 3. COR ROMI, interrogate pacer, holter monitor, ASA, ACE, BB, Zocor 4.ENDO RISS 5.RENAL gentle IVF for elevated creatinine likely pre renal etiology 6.DISPO SS consult. Obtain MR to see what w u has been done for patient at SHH for syncope. **PHI** MD **PHI**
