 Record date **PHI** BCH Cardiovascular Division CVD R12 **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** ( **PHI** **PHIDate** **PHI** **PHI** , M.D . **PHI** Memorial Nursing Home **PHI** Office **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** **PHI** Dear Dr. **PHI** **PHI** had the pleasure of seeing Mr. **PHI** in followup in Cardiology today . As you know , he is a 53 year old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on **PHIDate** for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring . His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and asthma . Prior to his pacemaker placement , an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain . He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds . The test was terminated for **PHIDate** substernal chest pain , but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted , so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant . Since the implant Mr. **PHI** describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished , however , he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations , which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker . Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa **PHI** 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction . His estimated battery longevity is 89 months . The atrial impedance is 569 **PHI** , the ventricular impedance is 529 **PHI** . The P wave is 5.6 mV . The R wave is 31.3 mV . The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV , and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec . In summary , Mr. **PHI** is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement . His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed . There is no sign of erythema or hematoma . However , his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing . Looking at his heart rate histogram , it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80 120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal . I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia . For this reason , I have performed a TSH today , which is normal , however , I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated . I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time . I plan to see Mr. **PHI** in followup in three months ' time , and if any issues arise in the interim , please do not hesitate to contact me .
